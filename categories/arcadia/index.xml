      <description>Welcome to In Arcadia Ego!
In Arcadia Ego is a narrative tabletop role-playing game for experienced GMs/Narrators. Each player takes the role of a regular person who, for some reason, has recently become Something Else – something we like to call an Arcadian. What is an Arcadian? Well, in fact, pretty much anything they can imagine, from a Bram Stoker-style Vampire to a creature of pure Mathematics made flesh, an Ancient God reborn or a fictional character become real.</description>
