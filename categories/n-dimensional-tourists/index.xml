      <description>Together, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-prepared, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed, well-trained, that&amp;rsquo;s even better. Well, whenever you group be together, or ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re well-prepared, well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed, well-trained or pretty much anything else, you are Creating an Advantage.
As most things in N-Dimensional Tourists, Advantages are basically Aspects and may represent just about anything that makes sense in-story. It could be a strong character providing the team with Muscle during a streetfight, or a Hand-up for climbing.</description>

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Aspects and your Sleeve</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-the-sleeve/</link>

      <description>While we have met Aspects a few times in this manual, so far, we have mostly contented ourselves with writing them down. Some are on your character sheet, some have been used to describe NPCs, or consequences of actions. In this chapter, we will discuss further what Aspects are and how they maybe used, both for the benefit of your character and against them.
Aspects in Narration Aspect are Facts First and foremost, Aspects are Facts.</description>

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Meeting Challenges</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-overcoming/</link>

      <description>So your character needs to find a key, lost somewhere in the mess left by the previous owner, or perhaps to pick the lock. Or maybe that piano needs to be moved into the living room, or you need to find a way through an opaque bureaucratic process, or to look innocent in front of a judge, or intimidating in front of a lowly thug. Or perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re fishing in a river or piloting your starship or settling a duel with another Musketeer before the Guards of the Cardinal show up?</description>

      <title>The Space Time Deck</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-space-time-deck/</link>

      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-space-time-deck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is a deck of 67 cards and a few blanks, loosely inspired
from Tarot decks, and designed to aid with story improv, including
Role-Playing Games and other forms of Storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the cards is designed to be interpreted on its own, and to be used
as part of a narrative role-playing ruleset. For both reasons, cards
have both illustrations and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is used throughout &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/plotonomicon&#34;&gt;the Plotonomicon&lt;/a&gt;
for building plots, characters, places, factions, twists, etc. and
throughout &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;the N-Dimensional Tourists&lt;/a&gt;
as a base for resolving obstacles, conflicts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Conflict Resolution</title>

      <description>THIS CONTENT IS DEPRECATED Playtesting has indicated that these rules don&amp;rsquo;t work as well as hoped.
We&amp;rsquo;ll leave them here for historical reasons, but newer versions of N-Dimensional Tourists do not use these rules.
 These rules describes how to resolve Conflicts between two parties or more during a role-playing game using the N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset. This mechanism is designed to be generic enough to handle pretty much any kind, while remaining mostly narrative.</description>

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: On your Character Sheet</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-attributes/</link>

      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-attributes/</guid>
      <description>In N-Dimensional Tourists, each major character is defined by:
 A Card, which is used during improv. Any number of Aspects, which determine what the character can do; 5 Attributes, which determine how good a character is at their tasks; Any number of Specialties, which let them use Attributes in unusual manners; At least one Weakness, which makes their life more complicated.  Minor non-player characters are typically described in even broader strokes, at least until the story calls upon them to be defined in more details.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists is a lightweight, generic ruleset for fiction-first, narrative roleplaying.
Instead of dice, it uses the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/space-time-deck&#34;&gt;Space·Time Deck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
