      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Conflict Resolution</title>

      <description>These rules are part of the N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset.
Specifically, this entry describes a mechanism to resolve Conflicts between two parties or more during a role-playing game. It is designed to be generic enough to cover pretty much any kind of Conflict with the same mechanism, while remaining narrative.
As you&amp;rsquo;ll see in this chapter, this mechanism is freely inspired from both Tarot and Blackjack – and it uses the Space·Time Deck.</description>

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: On your Character Sheet</title>

      <description>In N-Dimensional Tourists, each major character is defined by:
 Any number of Aspects, which determine what the character can do; 5 Attributes, which determine how good a character is at their tasks; Any number of Specialties, which let them use Attributes in unusual manners; At least one Weakness, which makes their life more complicated.  Minor non-player characters are typically described in even broader strokes, at least until the story calls upon them to be defined in more details.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists is a lightweight, generic ruleset for fiction-first, narrative roleplaying.
Instead of dice, it uses the Space·Time Deck.&lt;/p&gt;
