      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: On your Character Sheet</title>

      <description>In N-Dimensional Tourists, each major character is defined by:
 Any number of Aspects, which determine what the character can do; 5 Attributes, which determine how good a character is at their tasks; Any number of Specialties, which let them use Attributes in unusual manners; At least one Weakness, which makes their life more complicated.  Minor non-player characters are typically described in even broader strokes, at least until the story calls upon them to be defined in more details.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists is a lightweight, generic ruleset for fiction-first, narrative roleplaying,
based on the Space·Time Deck rather than dice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Conflict Resolution</title>
      <link>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-conflict-resolution/</link>

      <description>About these rules These rules are part of the N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset.
Specifically, this entry describes a mechanism to resolve Conflicts between two parties or more during a role-playing game.
This mechanism is designed to be abstract and generic – it works just as well with a pirate crew boarding a merchan ship as with two Formula 1 pilots racing each other or three political parties attempting to win or steal the elections.</description>
