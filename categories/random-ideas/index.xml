      <description>There are gods in this story, almighty or as near can be. This is not their story.
These gods shape and make history of mankind, Earth and beyond. This is not the story of mankind, Earth or beyond.
Let it be known that the gods have children, and that some of these children will ascend to godhood, while others will stop mere heroes or monsters, and the rest will fail and fall.</description>

      <title>An Idea for a future Role-Playing Game: Wandering Spirits</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a possible idea for a setting. It owns to Hurlements, Nephilim, Highlander, Continuum.
The story is set on our Earth, past, present and future.
The heroes are immortal, Wandering Spirits. They have existed on Earth since before Mankind, and will still be there after Mankind. In a way, they are gods: free to roam at will, to experience it all, without fear of consequences. In another way, they are but prisoners, condemned to live and relive the history of the world, either as passive observers, or as mere humans, borrowed for a day or a lifetime.</description>
