      <title>Ronin Time Bureaucrats: Afterlife and the Time Adjustment Foundation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the Time Federation is forever limited by its Prime Directive, the militarist branches managed to get away with murder, kidnapping and torture by finessing paradoxes. Some cadres of the Time Federation wanted the ability to counter-attack, and managed to create a covert operations branch called the &lt;strong&gt;Time Adjustment Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;. And further is exactly where it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>After the Suit of Paper, here comes the Suit of Rock.
Warning Museum-level nudity.
Rock traditionally symbolizes:
 stability; reliability; power.  The cards:
 Ruler  Dragon  Treasure  Soldier  Builder  Seeker  Lover  Servant  Home  Foot (blank, customizable)  Teddy bear (blank, customizable)   Note that the blue borders are not part of the cards. They are just there to delimit the safe-to-draw zone.</description>

      <description>After a few weeks spent composing, recomposing and polishing our Fate comic book tutorial, it&amp;rsquo;s now available on DriveThruRPG for pay-as-you-want, starting at $0.
As previously, the license allows you to share, reproduce and modify, provided you maintain credits, so feel free to bring it to your playing table.
We&amp;rsquo;re working on making it available print-on-demand.
Thanks to all the fine folks on Reddit communities /u/RPGdesign and /u/FATErpg for the feedback, and thanks to Evil Hat for making such a great game!</description>

      <title>A comic book tutorial for Fate Core</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/fate-rules-comic-leaflet/</link>

      <description>If you are interested in improv/narrative role-playing games, you may have heard of Fate Core, a great ruleset made by Evil Hat exactly for this purpose. It&amp;rsquo;s simple, it&amp;rsquo;s excellent, and it&amp;rsquo;s missing a tutorial, so here is one:
As you can see, it fits in one sheet, and it&amp;rsquo;s designed to be printed and brought with you at your table.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to make it available in other languages – if you wish to help, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch!</description>

      <description>« Nobody remembers with certainty in which year the Great Snafu took place, but people generally agree that it was on a September, or perhaps on a Saturday afternoon, on some even-numbered millenium. Also, it involved blowing up the Universe, which made pretty much everybody unhappy, except for a few people who had been waiting for this opportunity to loudly exclaim &amp;ldquo;I told you so&amp;rdquo;, and even they were not happy for long.</description>
