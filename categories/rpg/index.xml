      <description>About Conflicts TBD
Small recap of character attributes In N-Dimensional Tourists, each character is defined by: - Any number of Traits, which determine what the character can do; - 5 Attributes, which determine how good a character is at their tasks; - Any number of Specialties, which match Attributes to specific tasks; - At least one Weakness, which makes their life more complicated.
The Attributes are: - Rock (stability, authority, power, physical strength); - Paper (knowledge, deduction, riches); - Blades (violence, ability to effect change); - Serpent (speed, survival, stealth); - Unknown (imagination, intuition, perception).</description>

      <title>Conflict Resolution With the Space·Time Deck</title>

      <description>Most Role-Playing Games resolve conflicts with dice. But since we have a Space·Time Deck at hand (or any other kind of Tarot-like Deck), let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can use it to bring about a different manner of resolving conflicts.
About Conflicts A Conflict is a scene in which two parties or more have agendas, which cannot be fulfilled simultaneously. In most role-playing games, the most common form of conflict is the combat, but that is by no mean the only form possible: conflict could be car races, social wit, political campaigns, chess, battlefield strategy, attempting to ruin your opponent&amp;rsquo;s reputation or fortune, popularity contests, football matches, etc.</description>

      <title>Ronin Time Bureaucrats: Afterlife and the Time Adjustment Foundation</title>
      <link>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/rtb-time-adjustment-foundation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the Time Federation is forever limited by its Prime Directive, the militarist branches managed to get away with murder, kidnapping and torture by finessing paradoxes. Some cadres of the Time Federation wanted the ability to counter-attack, and managed to create a covert operations branch called the &lt;strong&gt;Time Adjustment Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;. And further is exactly where it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An idea for a future Role-Playing Game: Toys of the Gods</title>
      <link>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/an-idea-toys-of-the-gods/</link>

      <guid>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/an-idea-toys-of-the-gods/</guid>
      <description>There are gods in this story, almighty or as near can be. This is not their story.
These gods shape and make history of mankind, Earth and beyond. This is not the story of mankind, Earth or beyond.
Let it be known that the gods have children, and that some of these children will ascend to godhood, while others will stop mere heroes or monsters, and the rest will fail and fall.</description>

      <title>An Idea for a future Role-Playing Game: Wandering Spirits</title>

      <guid>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/an-idea-wandering-spirits/</guid>
      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a possible idea for a setting. It owns to Hurlements, Nephilim, Highlander, Continuum.
The story is set on our Earth, past, present and future.
The heroes are immortal, Wandering Spirits. They have existed on Earth since before Mankind, and will still be there after Mankind. In a way, they are gods: free to roam at will, to experience it all, without fear of consequences. In another way, they are but prisoners, condemned to live and relive the history of the world, either as passive observers, or as mere humans, borrowed for a day or a lifetime.</description>

      <title>Improvising with the Space·Time Deck: V. Hello, you gorgeous!</title>
      <link>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/deck-5/</link>

      <description>This is an extract from the Plotonomicon.
Note that we have just changed the picture from
The old picture (The Slaughter of the Innocents) one was considered too violent – while both are museum pieces, the first one depicts mass murder of children, and was thus discarded as not-safe-for-children&amp;rsquo;s-hands.
This new version gets rid of almost all violence, and offers much more symbolism, hence much more freedom of improv.</description>

      <description>Oops, the heroes have ruined the story, again. They managed to get Camelot invaded by the peaceful Seelie while King Arthur was at war, to kill teenage Karl Marx while vacationing in Space·Time or to blow up the Magical University where the entire campaign was meant to take place. Also, they have just entered the Unknowable Dungeon of Unspeakable Death, for which you have no maps, or they are due to meet the Ambassador of the Qfew&amp;rsquo;dhi Confederation, the one you just invented by pushing random keys on your keyboard.</description>

      <title>Improv(is)ing stories with cards</title>
      <link>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/why-cards/</link>

      <guid>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/why-cards/</guid>
      <description>Earlier, we have posted the Space·Time Deck.
It&amp;rsquo;s a set of cards, designed to help with improv.
But why cards?
In theory, an improv Storyteller should be able to use anything as support for improvisation. That&amp;rsquo;s true whether they&amp;rsquo;re performing for an audience, or improvising a plot for an ongoing Role-Playing Game, or improvising their character as a RPG player, or writing a book.
Do you know the ideal improviser? His name is Keyser Söze.</description>

      <description>If you are interested in improv/narrative role-playing games, you may have heard of Fate Core, a great ruleset made by Evil Hat exactly for this purpose. It&amp;rsquo;s simple, it&amp;rsquo;s excellent, and it&amp;rsquo;s missing a tutorial, so here is one:
As you can see, it fits in one sheet, and it&amp;rsquo;s designed to be printed and brought with you at your table.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to make it available in other languages – if you wish to help, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch!</description>

      <description>« Nobody remembers with certainty in which year the Great Snafu took place, but people generally agree that it was on a September, or perhaps on a Saturday afternoon, on some even-numbered millenium. Also, it involved blowing up the Universe, which made pretty much everybody unhappy, except for a few people who had been waiting for this opportunity to loudly exclaim &amp;ldquo;I told you so&amp;rdquo;, and even they were not happy for long.</description>
