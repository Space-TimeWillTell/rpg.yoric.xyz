      <description>After the Paper Suit and the Rock Suit, here comes the Scissor Suit.
Warning Museum-level nudity.
Scissors traditionally symbolize:
 change; violence; unavoidability.  The cards: - Ruler - Dragon - Treasure - Soldier - Builder - Seeker - Lover - Servant - Home - Foot (blank, customizable) - Teddy bear (blank, customizable) Note that the blue borders are not part of the cards. They are just there to delimit the safe-to-draw zone.</description>

      <description>This is an extract from the Plotonomicon.
Note that we have just changed the picture from
The old picture (The Slaughter of the Innocents) one was considered too violent – while both are museum pieces, the first one depicts mass murder of children, and was thus discarded as not-safe-for-children&amp;rsquo;s-hands.
This new version gets rid of almost all violence, and offers much more symbolism, hence much more freedom of improv.</description>
