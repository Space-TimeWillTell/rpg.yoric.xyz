      <title>Ronin Time Bureaucrats: The Most Benevolent Administrators</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Most Benevolent Administrators&lt;/strong&gt; are believed to be leftovers of a dead branch of the &lt;strong&gt;Time Bureaucracy&lt;/strong&gt;. They may be found scattered around time and space. While they look quite harmless – who would fear something that appears essentially to be photocopier on wheel tracks – the sheets of paper that they print sometimes make them very dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Benevolent Administrators are generally Poets and Philosophers, able of deep reflections on the nature of the human psyche, among others. They are also extremely perceptive and their writings are eloquent as very few human beings can be. Surprisingly, they often use these skills, combined, for the perceived benefits of others. Wherever a Most Benevolent Administrator shows up – which may be pretty much anywhere in Space·Time – expect that within a few months, people will be inventing Social Security and Universities and Parliaments, building Cathedrals, Towers of Babel and Starships and Utopias. Sadly, very few civilizations can survive such a level of ascension, and the rule of a Most Benevolent Administrator most often ends with bloody revolutions, invasions, cataclysms or self-immolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Benevolent Administrators are rather peaceful, and will not incite a civilization to war when it could be using its own life essence to produce immortal pieces of art. The only known exception is when two Most Benevolent Administrators show up in the same Time·Space – this always ends up in a savage war to the last man standing, for obscure philosophical or religious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Plotonomicon: Creating Worlds</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/plotonomicon-creating-worlds/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the Plotonomicon, creating a world is, much like creating a character, a series of Questions.
Where creating a player&amp;rsquo;s character is generally a dialogue between the GM and that player,
creating a world is one that involves everybody around the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to decide how much detail you want to put in your world –
there&amp;rsquo;s no limit to how much time you can spend creating a world, if you enjoy doing so,
but maybe you want to use that world immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;quick-start-world&#34;&gt;Quick Start World&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story has started. You have promised an epic of sword &amp;amp; sorcery, the characters are ready,
you just don&amp;rsquo;t have a world upon which to unleash them. So let&amp;rsquo;s spend the least amount of time
to get the story rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple Question: &lt;em&gt;Where do we start&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player A draws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-76.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-76.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 76, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;Obviously, we start with some kind of forest. &lt;em&gt;Fading into myth&lt;/em&gt;? Maybe some kind of mystical forest that has somehow vanished from time and space.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;What happens in the forest?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-51.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-51.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 51, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Since this Earth is square, I believe that the forest works with different laws of physics than the main world. That&amp;rsquo;s not very surprising, as this is a mystical forest. It is also a &lt;em&gt;Stationary Earth&lt;/em&gt;, so&amp;hellip; for some reason, the forest has stayed in the same place while the world was moving. Perhaps due to different laws of physics, it only appears in some season, when Earth is in the right position in its orbit around the Sun?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;All of this is useful, but don&amp;rsquo;t forget to answer Player A&amp;rsquo;s Question!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Oh, yes, what&amp;rsquo;s happening &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the forest. Well, &lt;em&gt;New life into old ideas&lt;/em&gt;. Or instead of ideas, this could be spirits. So, the spirits of the forest have been dormant for a long time, and they are returning to life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Very well. That&amp;rsquo;s almost sufficient to get started. I just have one last Question: &lt;em&gt;What are the heroes doing here?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-44.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-44.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 44, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re following rumors of a monster. Actually, we&amp;rsquo;re following the tracks of some kind of monster. This lead us here. We&amp;rsquo;re probably lost now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous things that you do not know about this forest. What do the spirits look
or sound like? What do they want? How will they react to the heroe&amp;rsquo;s intrusion? What does
the monster look like? Why are the spirits asleep?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All good Questions, which may be answered during the story, as the characters encounter
these inhabitants and the monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, you have enough to get the story rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-game-is-world-building&#34;&gt;The game is world-building&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the story is about the world itself, rather than its inhabitants. Or perhaps,
you enjoy a session to build the world before telling stories in it. If so, you have
more time ahead of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, let&amp;rsquo;s play Question ping-pong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;What caused the spirits to wake-up?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-15.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-15.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 15, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Great Progress&lt;/em&gt;. So, we are talking about Earth, our Earth or one that looks very much like it. Somehow, scientific discoveries are awakening the Spirits of Nature trapped in the Forest. Probably something related to space, maybe satellites?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;What trapped the Spirits of Nature in the Forest?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-73.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-73.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 73, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;Old age, simply. The Spirits of Nature were born with Nature herself, and progressively grew old. They went to
the Forest to die, until that satellite woke them up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;How long have the Spirits of Nature being trapped here?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-77.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-77.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 77, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;Since the fire lizards came out of the seas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;Where is the Forest, exactly?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-57.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-57.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 57, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Mmmh&amp;hellip;. &lt;em&gt;Some kind of street performer&lt;/em&gt;? Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough about statues to be sure, but it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s from South-East Asia. So, I would say&amp;hellip; Hong Kong. The Forest now covers the city of Hong Kong! Also, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;gracious and deadly&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure exactly what that means, but for some reason, people are attracted to the Forest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;When did the Forest show up?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-79.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-79.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 79, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;Oh, that one is tricky. I see a bat-winged serpent-woman, a man in armor, a window, also &lt;em&gt;We need to talk&lt;/em&gt;, etc. Any ideas?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t there a year of the dragon? Or a year of the serpent?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Something related to a breakup?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;The retrocession of Hong Kong to the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll go with the breakup, but figuratively. Say, there was an earthquake somewhere in South-East Asia a few months ago. One of the worst in history, and it caused massive Tsunamis. That&amp;rsquo;s when the Forest arrived in Hong Kong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d like to return to the Spirits of Nature. I wonder, &lt;em&gt;What are the Spirits of Nature going to do?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-70.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-70.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 70, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;Obviously, they are going to cross the water. They are going to colonize Mainland China, because &lt;em&gt;No Obstacle is Too Great&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;I wonder, &lt;em&gt;What is the situation in the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-16.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-16.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 16, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Too much of a good thing?&lt;/em&gt; This could be nature recovering, or the country being so rich that it can&amp;rsquo;t cope with internal societal changes. Actually, why choose? This is a period of social reforms, where each day is full of promises, where pollution decreases, life expectancy increases&amp;hellip; and in this setting, nobody cares all that much about Hong Kong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s stop here. We have our Earth, nearly unchanged. We have a mysterious forest, peopled by entirely alien Spirits of Nature. We have a huge earthquake, which may have been caused by the Forest, or may have caused its reappearance. We have one of the largest and richest cities in the world, essentially vanished. We have the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China, ignoring the threat that grows in its own South. We have some Fire Lizards, which may return at some point in the story. It is quite possible that adventurers of all sorts are converging on Hong Kong, hoping to rescue survivors, plunder its riches or study its ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, we already have a rich seed for a setting, and we may continue as long as we have Questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-did-we-do-that&#34;&gt;How did we do that?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual with the Plotonomicon, once we have the right Questions, everything else fits nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among starting Questions, we recommend something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where do we start?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does this place look like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does it feel like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is the main problem?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How did that happen?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is going to happen now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are people doing about it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What can the heroes do about it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and from then, if you have time to proceed, Question ping-pong!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Stronger Together</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Together, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-prepared, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed,
well-trained, that&amp;rsquo;s even better. Well, whenever you group be together, or ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re well-prepared,
well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed, well-trained or pretty much anything else, you are
&lt;strong&gt;Creating an Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-parties/Danse_macabre_by_Michael_Wolgemut.png&#34; alt=&#34;Dance of Death by Michael Wolgemut – Public Domain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most things in N-Dimensional Tourists, Advantages are basically Aspects and may represent
just about anything that makes sense in-story. It could be a strong character providing the
team with &lt;strong&gt;Muscle&lt;/strong&gt; during a streetfight, or a &lt;strong&gt;Hand-up for climbing&lt;/strong&gt;. It could be an
anime scientist building &lt;strong&gt;Mechs to defeat the alien invasion&lt;/strong&gt;, or a super-villain scientist
providing &lt;strong&gt;Green Rocks that absorb Ultraman&amp;rsquo;s power&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declare what Advantage you are creating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating that Advantage is a Challenge, so reach an agreement with the GM on Reach and Risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempt to Meet the Challenge, using the regular rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have succeeded, you have created the advantage. Congratulations, the Aspect is created,
write it down on an index card. Depending on your Success Ranks, you may need to adjust the
actual Aspect written down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have Success Ranks, leave the cards that gave you these ranks on the index card. Ignore
orientation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a Cost, you have also created an Aspect that works against you. Write
it down on an index card. The GM draws as many Sleeve Cards and puts them on the
index card. These Sleeve Cards are meant to be used against you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;example-chess-match&#34;&gt;Example: Chess Match&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After realizing that Lady Buckingham didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well against Lord Dervon during the early
match, Lord Robson (PC) has decided to help
Lady Buckingham as best as he can, by attempting to draw the attention of Lord Devon away from
the game. For this purpose, Lord Robson will use his mirror watch to reflect light onto Lord
Dervon&amp;rsquo;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t look particularly hard, but it&amp;rsquo;s also going to be a minor distraction,
right? I mean, once he realizes what&amp;rsquo;s going on, he can simply ask you politely to stop. Also,
if people realize what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, you&amp;rsquo;re going to look a bit childish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Well, people know me as an eccentric, so looking childish won&amp;rsquo;t hurt my reputation
overmuch.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok. So the difficulty is Fair (2), let me draw cards for the Challenge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-44.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-44.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 44, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, getting a narrow light straight on your mirror in this crowded room full of statues
and decorations is actually a little bit more complicated than it looks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-13.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-13.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 13, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Also, did I mention that the room is crowded?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;As this is sleight of hand, I&amp;rsquo;ll be drawing my Good (3) Serpents. That&amp;rsquo;s already two reversed
cards, which isn&amp;rsquo;t very good for me. Ah, well, let&amp;rsquo;s draw.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-23.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-23.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 23, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;So, on the upside, I am succeeding, despite all the difficulties, at getting some light in
Lord Dervon&amp;rsquo;s eyes. That&amp;rsquo;s thanks to a mirror representing Hamlet&amp;rsquo;s Ophelia. It might be a little
visible, though.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-11.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-11.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 11, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Ouch, such a crowd! Someone just elbowed me in an attempt to look better, so I&amp;rsquo;ll need to move.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-46.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-46.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 46, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Yes, definitely a better position. From here, I can point the light straight into his face.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-73.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-73.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 73, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; and help myself to some of this delicious champagne.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Well, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stop here. So, while I do manage to get some light into Dervon&amp;rsquo;s eyes,
I have had to move a bit around the room to do so, which attracts a few stares as I elbow and
get elbowed in return. I have decided on my course of action and will not relent, though.
As an Advantage, I&amp;rsquo;ll pick &lt;strong&gt;A little twinkling in the eye&lt;/strong&gt;, with Average (1), so one card.
And for a disadvantage, I&amp;rsquo;ll pick &lt;strong&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s a bit rude, isn&amp;rsquo;t he?&lt;/strong&gt;, also Average (1), so you
get one card.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;You have two unique cards, which one do you pick?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;They are equivalent, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;In terms of probabilities, yes, they are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Well, say, this one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-73.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-73.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-horizontal-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 73, horizontal&#34;
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GM also draws one card for &lt;strong&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s a bit rude, isn&amp;rsquo;t he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-70.png&#34;

        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-horizontal-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 70, horizontal&#34;
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h1 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju Attack&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Levinulon has destroyed the Bank of Japan, as well as a number of other buildings, before the
Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force managed to attract its attention. By now, however, both the Infantry
(PC) and the Air Force (PC) have managed to deploy. Neither will be able to bear the brunt of the
combat against Levinulon, but that&amp;rsquo;s ok, they are both going to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;I think that our main role at this stage will be to evacuate the Civilians, to make
sure that the Mechs can use their weapons without causing collateral damage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Can I wait until I know how the Infantry is doing before deciding whether I&amp;rsquo;m here
to carpet bomb Levinulon or to distract it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sure, so, Infantry, your Reach is to evacuate all Civilians from combat areas in time. What
kind of Risk do you foresee?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Well, our forces are spread thin, so we might not succeed at evacuating everyone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sure, but that&amp;rsquo;s already covered by the Reach and the Rank of the Challenge. For Risk, I&amp;rsquo;d
say that you need all your vehicles and all your men, and you&amp;rsquo;re pretty sure that you&amp;rsquo;re going
to have casualties in your ranks. Right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;How am I going to have casualties?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, if you send your men to evacuate Civilians, this means that they have to evacuate last,
right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Oh, sure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, so the combat line isn&amp;rsquo;t moving very fast, but there are lots of Civilians, so the
difficulty will be Good (3).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Alright. Can I use my Superb (5) Rock for authority?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Definitely.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GM draws for the Obstacle:&lt;/p&gt;

        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;So, &lt;em&gt;Too many secrets&lt;/em&gt; – in the area where the conflict has moved, there are lots
of small alleys, little houses, people living in basements due to high rent. Sounds like
Infantry will have difficulties reaching everyone in time. In some places, it looks even
like a small hanging city, with planks and scaffolding used to access some of the houses
(&lt;em&gt;Show of Skills&lt;/em&gt;). The maps for the area are clearly not very good (&lt;em&gt;Lack of Precision&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry draws:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Well, my officers are pretty good, thank you very much. They didn&amp;rsquo;t reach their
rank (&lt;em&gt;Rising to Power&lt;/em&gt;) out of supidity, but thanks to their ability to organize their
soldiers even in high-pressure, low-information situations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry draws:&lt;/p&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that this area is full of drug dens and low-grade brothels,
but my men are doing their work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Forth reversed card, first reports of losses. Vehicles were destroyed under the
feet of the beast. But we soldier on!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Communications are more complicated. The battlefield has reached us, isolating units
from their officers and from each other, but we will soldier on!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img

                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 65, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;But I have &lt;em&gt;Absolute Trust&lt;/em&gt; in my officers and soldiers, and they prove that they
deserve this trust, by saving a considerable number of civilians. Go ahead, Tokyo Mechanized
Defense Force, beat the monster!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;So, it looks like have taken some losses of both material and men in this labyrinth,
Good soldiers who could not get away in time after having saved the lives of so many civilians.
You will be remembered!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry writes down &lt;strong&gt;The battlefield has been evacuated&lt;/strong&gt; and adds the pair on the index card:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure

            alt=&#34;Card number 68&#34;
        /&gt;
    
        
        
        
        &lt;img

            alt=&#34;Card number 65&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infantry may now give one or both of these cards to any character, as long as it makes sense that
the character is supported by the Aspect. The idea is to hand these cards to the Tokyo Mechanized
Defense Force, but the Air Force could be interested, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry adds &lt;strong&gt;The Infantry suffered losses&lt;/strong&gt;, on which the GM may now add two cards:&lt;/p&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 48&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Since &lt;strong&gt;The battlefield has been evacuated&lt;/strong&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide air support, bombing
Levinulon as often as possible without hurting the Infantry or the Tokyo Mechanized Defense
Force.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, you have serious firepower at hand, so you could possibly hurt Levinulon severely.
On the other hand, you risk accidentally bombing either the Infantry or the Tokyo Mechanized
Defense Force, resulting in serious losses. Or maybe you wish to reduce your Risk and Reach?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Nah, let&amp;rsquo;s take chances.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, so, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be Fairly (2) easy, with all your high-tech equipment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Cool. Should I use my Fair (2) Paper for intelligent strikes or my Superb (5) Serpent
for dogfighting and speed?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Depends on your style. If you&amp;rsquo;re playing it fast and furious, you could youse the Serpent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Serpent it is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM Draws&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;All the smoke of destruction is making things somewhat hard to see (&lt;em&gt;Entering the Dark Realm&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Ok, I&amp;rsquo;ll draw.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Actually, wait a second. I&amp;rsquo;ll use one of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; Sleeve Cards against you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM takes one of the cards from &lt;strong&gt;The Infantry suffered losses&lt;/strong&gt;, covering one of his cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Since the &lt;strong&gt;Infantry has suffered losses&lt;/strong&gt; of vehicles and equipment, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Madness&lt;/em&gt; down there.
You&amp;rsquo;re going to receive contradictory reports from the battlefield, which don&amp;rsquo;t let you aim as well
as you want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t think so! I can use my cards to support the Air Force instead of you,
right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;As long as it makes sense in-story, yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;In this case, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; your cards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 65&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Thanks to the great job done by the infantry, however, you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly receive precise
dispatches that will make your life easier.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Force Draws:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is already a Success with an Effect of 2 and a Cost of 0. Pretty good for a single card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;My ace pilots are turning Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s huge size into a handicap, as it cannot turn
quickly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Bomb after bomb falls on Levinulon, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to fall!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 76&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No Cost!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force plays again, they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use these three cards, which will
undoubtedly considerably tilt the balance!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Aspects and your Sleeve</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-the-sleeve/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2018 12:09:13 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-the-sleeve/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;While we have met Aspects a few times in this manual, so far,
we have mostly contented ourselves with writing them down.
Some are on your character sheet, some have been used to describe
NPCs, or consequences of actions. In this chapter, we will
discuss further what Aspects &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how they maybe used&lt;/em&gt;,
both for the benefit of your character and against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;aspects-in-narration&#34;&gt;Aspects in Narration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-the-sleeve/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights17.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sani ol-Molk – Sheherazade and the Sultan (from the One Thousand and One Nights) – Public Domain – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspect-are-facts&#34;&gt;Aspect are Facts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, Aspects are Facts. Anything that is written down
as an Aspect is true and undeniable. Aspects are one of the few strict
rules in this game that deal with what may or what may not be narrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a scene has Aspect
&lt;strong&gt;Dark and rainy outside&lt;/strong&gt;, then it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dark and rainy outside,
until there is a good in-story reason for this Aspect to become
irrelevant. At some point it, it is likely that the storm will pass
and the sun will rise. Unless your characters are some kind of weather
control mutants or omnipotent deities – and we&amp;rsquo;re going to assume that
they aren&amp;rsquo;t – this Aspect will stick to the
scene, and any event that takes place during that scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, whatever may happen &lt;em&gt;in a different scene&lt;/em&gt;, for the moment,
it is dark and rainy outside. One of the consequences of this is
that the Players and the GM alike are &lt;em&gt;forbidden&lt;/em&gt; from narrating
anything that contradicts this Fact. If you recall, a Challenge
is a single scene. Consequently, if the current scene has heroes
fighting vampires, and if they need a ray of sun to get rid of
these pesky light-allergic creatures, that is too bad for them,
because this cannot happen for the moment. The vampires might
suffer negative Effects from the Challenge, but the Reach of
the heroes will not, in any manner, offer the ability of exposing
vampires to the sun. Perhaps, after this Challenge, the scene
may be changed and altered, the clouds will split, dawn will
rise and the vampires will suffer from it. But not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this works both ways: if the heroes are the vampires,
fighting petty vampire hunters, regardless of the Cost of the
Challenge, the GM is forbidden from having the sun rise on
the now heroic bloodsuckers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspects-are-permissions&#34;&gt;Aspects are Permissions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as an Aspect closes some narrative avenues, an Aspect opens
others. Whether PC or NPC, a &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt; will, by
definition, know everything there is to know about being an
assassin and have access to all the equipment, money and contacts
that a professional assassin should have. Whenever the character
is involved in a Challenge, this Aspect will let the Player or GM
narrate both successes and failures as those of a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is true for a &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt; is, of course, even
more true whenever superpowers are involved, whether the character
is the &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Seas&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;World-class telekinetic&lt;/strong&gt;, the
&lt;strong&gt;Youngest Witchmistress of her Generation&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;Bumbling
Time Traveler&lt;/strong&gt;. These Aspects authorize you to narrate actions
that most characters in the setting wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, in any Challenge, Aspects have considerable impact
on Reach and Risk. As a &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt;, you may be able to
snipe the &lt;strong&gt;Modern Necromancer&lt;/strong&gt; before he raises an army of the
dead (Reach), but this Aspect won&amp;rsquo;t help you cast a counter-spell
(also Reach). As a &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Seas&lt;/strong&gt;, you may be able to shrug
anything that the whale hunters throw at you (Cost), but you may
suffer considerably if you can&amp;rsquo;t save the oiler ship (also Cost).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspects-and-balance&#34;&gt;Aspects and Balance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be tempting to assume that Aspects should make draws
easier, but they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t – simply to maintain the game somewhat
balanced and playable despite differences of power scale
between characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, for instance, a super-hero team with a &lt;strong&gt;Indestructible
Super-strong Flying Warrior Demi-goddess&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;Skilled archer
with trick arrows&lt;/strong&gt;, both of them PCs. Imagine them fighting
side-by-side against an &lt;strong&gt;Alien, Multi-bodied, Civilization-destroying Robot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of relative power, yes, the Demi-goddess is impossibly
stronger, and faster, than the Archer. In terms of game, though,
how fun would it for the players if only one could succeed their draws,
simply because of different Aspects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason for which, in movies and comics and novels and
stories of all kind that feature characters of different power levels,
each major character has the opportunity to affect the outcome of
a conflict. This is the reason for which, in N-Dimensional Tourists,
the Aspects of the characters do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; influence the Rank of Challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, consider the Challenge of attacking the Robot&amp;rsquo;s near-indestructible
Unobtainium body. The Robot is pretty slow and attacking it is not very
hard – in fact, the Rank of that Challenge is probably only Good (3). The
difficulty, in this case, is not in the attack, but in doing something
meaningful with it. As we have seen above, Aspects may very well influence
the Reach and Cost of a Challenge. So, while the Demi-goddess&amp;rsquo;s Reach allows
her to reasonably &lt;em&gt;Reduce the mobility of the Unobtainium Body even further
by damaging its limbs&lt;/em&gt;, the Archer&amp;rsquo;s trick explosive arrows
allow him to reasonably &lt;em&gt;Weaken the ground around the Robot, making it
fall into the sewers, where its mobility will be greatly reduced.&lt;/em&gt; If
the Demi-goddess attacks with unarmed combat, she may Risk &lt;em&gt;Being grappled
and immobilized by the Unobtainium Body&lt;/em&gt;. The Archer remains afar, so risks
very little for himself, but his strategy could prove &lt;em&gt;Dangerous for the
civilians still in the area&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus is Balance narratively maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-sleeve-economy&#34;&gt;The Sleeve Economy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-the-sleeve/639px-Poker_cheating_20170611.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Santeri Viinamäki – A poker card in your Sleeve – Licensed under  Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen that each player starts a session by drawing three Sleeve Cards.
We have also seen that player can receive Sleeve Cards by conceding Challenges.
What we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen yet is how these Sleeve Cards are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;compelling-aspects&#34;&gt;Compelling Aspects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider our &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt;. What are the chances that there&amp;rsquo;s
an Interpol Taskforce after her? What are the chances that she already
knows the Di Carpa family, having already executed a contract for them?
Consider our &lt;strong&gt;Dark and rainy outside&lt;/strong&gt;
scene. What is the chance that this will lead to a blizzard? Consider
a character suffering from unhealed &lt;strong&gt;Leg Trauma&lt;/strong&gt;. What are the chances
that he&amp;rsquo;ll have to stop the chase due to terrible pain? Consider a
doorway, covered with bloody glyphs, through which a &lt;strong&gt;Hypnotic song&lt;/strong&gt;
may be heard. What are the chances that one of the heroes will listen
to the song of the siren and cross the threshold? Consider a setting
in which, because of Paradoxes, &lt;strong&gt;Killing Time-Travelers is More Trouble than it is Worth&lt;/strong&gt;.
What are the chances that the Robotic Overlords will capture and interrogate
the outmatched heroes, rather than executing them outright?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as Aspects enable and forbid stories from taking place, they can be
used to make something happen – or have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick the Aspect you wish to Compel. It can be any Aspect, belonging to
the scene, a PC, a NPC, an object&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick one of your Sleeve Cards. If you are the GM, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck, you
have an unlimited number of Sleeve Cards in the Space·Time Deck in
front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narrate &amp;ldquo;Since [the Aspect is true], chances are that [something else,
based on both this Aspect and the card you picked, is also true].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This mechanism is called a &lt;strong&gt;Compel&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are Compelling yourself,
a NPC, an object, a scene, or if you
are Compelling a PC to make their life easier&amp;hellip; the Sleeve Card goes
into the Space·Time Deck. If you are Compelling a PC to make their
life harder, the Sleeve Card is for that PC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the Compel is on a PC, that player may reject the Compel, in which
case you get to keep your Sleeve Card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compels require no Challenge. Once a Compel has been accepted, it becomes
automatically true, generally a new Aspect if that&amp;rsquo;s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For players, Compels typically serve to alter the story and make their
life easier. This is, often, how a character happens to already know a
place or a story or a NPC. This is also, sometimes, how a group of adventurers
hired to enter a dungeon and look for an artifact, happens to have already
acquired the map of the dungeon – or possibly already beaten it – on their
spare time, hence requiring the GM to adapt and improvise a new objective
for the plot. Or maybe, for a Demi-goddess, this is how you just decide
that a minor supervillain is no match for you, by simply Compelling your
victory in hand-to-hand combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the GM, Compels serve several objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are a good way to introduce NPCs, factions, objects and tie
them to the background of a PC;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are a good way to introduce new complications in the life of
the heroes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are a good way to make a PC do something that the player knows
is stupide, but that makes entire sense in-story (recall that the
player may refuse);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the heroes are running low on Sleeve Cards, it is a good mechanism
to reload them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note for GMs: as a general guideline, if a player answers your narration
by &amp;ldquo;Oh, no!&amp;rdquo; and then eagerly takes the Sleeve Card offered, your Compel
was probably spot on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspects-may-be-tricked&#34;&gt;Aspects may be Tricked&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way, there is another way to use Sleeve Cards and Aspects,
it&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;strong&gt;Tricking&lt;/strong&gt;, and it helps you during Challenges, by
letting you cover a card that you have just drawn or that your
opponent has just drawn, with one of the cards up your Sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick the Aspect you wish to &lt;strong&gt;Trick&lt;/strong&gt;. It could be one of your
Aspects, or it could belong to your opponent, to the scene, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick one of your Sleeve Cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpret the card you&amp;rsquo;re covering and narrate it as what you
    have just escaped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpret the card you&amp;rsquo;re using and narrate it as what ended
    up happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narrate how the Aspect saved you, or helped save you from the
    one to the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the Challenge draws all cards at once. You may cover any
(or all) of the cards after they have all been drawn. You can only
use each Aspect once per Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule works both for the Players and the GM. However, for this
use, the GM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an unlimited Sleeve. The size of the Sleeve
depends on the importance of the Challenge. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss this in the
chapter dedicated to setting up advanced Challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role-Playing Game Pitch: Kingdom Came</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/an-idea-kingdom-came/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2018 11:56:38 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/an-idea-kingdom-came/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rejoice, for the Kingdom of Death is no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was first reported Last Thursday, at 0421 GMT and it happened all over the globe: the dead have returned to walk among the living. They are disoriented, surely, and returned from Heaven or Hell or other places, but they are peaceful, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What most of them are no more is &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;. For &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the dead have returned, all since the first step of our kind, or possibly before, and few of them have a body to return to. The fresh ones, the ones who had died just a few moments after the event, those woke up without a pulse and continued their day without realizing that something was amiss. The decayed ones, the ones who had been in the ground or under the water for weeks or years or centuries, those woke up as creatures of their own nightmares, without context or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the rest? Those who had been cremated or destroyed by time or beasts or accident? Well, those had to find something to inhabit, didn&amp;rsquo;t they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, 0421 GMT is now known as the Kingdom Came event. And since Kingdom Came, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; can host a returned human being. It could be your toaster or a book in your library. It could be your favorite earring or your camera. It could be Google or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejoice, for the Kingdom of Death is no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejoice, for the Dead have returned, from Heaven or Hell or other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how will society cope?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All good things start with stories. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a buzzphrase, by the way.
If you are building a story, whether you are role-playing, storytelling for
an audience or writing a book, the story comes first and everything else
tends to follow naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let us start with, once again, a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;hope-renewed&#34;&gt;Hope renewed&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our story is set in a fantasy archipelago inhabited by dozens of sentient
species, and loosely inspired from Ancient Greece, with larger ships.
One by one, the islands have fallen to the powerful and evil Spartan
Legion, whose overlord now rules the archipelago nearly uncontested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/plotonomicon-the-art-of-not-preparing/1024px-Hoplites_fight_Louvre_E735.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kleimachos – Hoplites fighting.

&lt;p&gt;So far, these are a few sentences that most GMs could improv before coffee.
We&amp;rsquo;ll see more about preparing/improvising campaigns and settings later.
For the moment, we&amp;rsquo;re only interested in major NPCs, so we&amp;rsquo;ll let the story flow without much
detail and concentrate only in the introduction of these NPCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first player arrives. The GM tells him about the archipelago, the
Spartan Legion, the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;So, what kind of character would you like to play?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 1: &amp;ldquo;Mmmh&amp;hellip; Well, obviously, a future hero. I don&amp;rsquo;t know much
about the setting yet. so let&amp;rsquo;s start with someone who&amp;rsquo;s not involved
in the war at all. Maybe some kind of farmer&amp;rsquo;s kid, eager for adventure.
I&amp;rsquo;ll call him Desmondos.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desmondos doesn&amp;rsquo;t know much about the war&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desmondos grew up on a farm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desmondos is eager for adventure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;entering-the-plot&#34;&gt;Entering the plot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Alright. This story is going to be about you, and the other PCs,
taking an active part in the war against the Spartan Legion.
Desmondos, can you tell me how you &lt;em&gt;enter this plot&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Could I receive a message accidentally? Some magical
message that&amp;rsquo;s meant for an enemy of the Spartan Legion, who
hides on the same island as me, but for some reason, I got the
message, and since I&amp;rsquo;m eager for adventure, I decide to bring
it to the intended recipient?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;That sound good. Player 3 told me that she wants to play
some kind of princess. Let&amp;rsquo;s say it&amp;rsquo;s from her. It will create
the first relationship between your characters. Once Player 3
arrives, we&amp;rsquo;ll see later how she gets drawn into that plot.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how she wants to call her character, but let&amp;rsquo;s
say Erikaia. We&amp;rsquo;ll change the names retroactively if she
doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Yeah, I received a message from Princess Erikaia.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, now tell me more about this message.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Well, it seems to be encrypted somehow. But it&amp;rsquo;s clearly meant
for a general, an enemy of the Spartan Legion, who hides on this island.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sounds good. I&amp;rsquo;ll need a name for this general.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;General Gregorios, of the Free Company.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Free Company fights the Spartan Legion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Gregorios, of the Free Company, hides on this island&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-general&#34;&gt;The General&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few adventures, Desmondos manages to locate General
Gregorios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;So, tell me more about this General Gregorios.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s in his fifties and he&amp;rsquo;s some kind of Paladin. He&amp;rsquo;s very strong, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok. General Gregorios tells you a bit more about the Spartan Legion – basically
what we had established during campaign creation. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s lead by a general
called&amp;hellip; Drakon the Undefeated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Oh, and can Gregorios take me as an apprentice? I want to become a Paladin like him!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Gregorios smiles at your requests and answers &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Well, you have certainly proven worthy. We can give it a try.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GM ponders it a second, and decides that since Gregorios is clearly
much stronger than Desmondos – and all threats should be scaled for
Desmondos and his friends rather than for Gregorios – Gregorios doesn&amp;rsquo;t
need a character sheet. If necessary, Gregorios may be used as a &lt;em&gt;bonus&lt;/em&gt;
to make things possible or improve the results of Desmondos&amp;rsquo; actions.
Not creating the character sheet immediately means that the GM is free
to improvise the exact strength and powers of Gregorios as the story
evolves, and to tailor it to wherever the story leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Gregorios is in his fifties.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Gregorios is some kind of Paladin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Gregorios is much stronger than the heroes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Gregorios is now the mentor of Desmondos.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a General Drakon the Undefeated of the Spartan Legion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-threat&#34;&gt;The Threat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once decyphered, the message tells of a terrible threat,
some kind of spell that will forever erase freewill from
the mind of all inhabitants of the archipelago. General
Gregorios is the last hope of the Free Company and the
archipelago. Gregorios and Desmondos decide that they
need a ship to reach the hidden camp of the Free Company,
to warn them of the terrible danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:
- &lt;strong&gt;The Spartan Legion is about to unleash a terrible spell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-challenger-has-arrived&#34;&gt;A new challenger has arrived&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, Player 2 has just arrived!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 2: &amp;ldquo;Sorry about that, I hope you guys started without me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;We certainly did. Desmondos, do you wish to tell Player 2
about what has happened so far?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: [&amp;hellip;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; and so, we arrive to the moment where the heroes are
looking for a way to leave the island and reach the hidden
camp of the Free Company. Does this give you ideas for a
character?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 2: &amp;ldquo;Yeah. Could I be some kind of mercenary&amp;hellip; no, say
a smuggler? I have my own ship, it&amp;rsquo;s small, it&amp;rsquo;s fast, it
can get around the islands quickly and unseen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;That would certainly work. So, your plot introduction is
that you&amp;rsquo;re going to be hired to bring the other heroes to
their destination, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 2: &amp;ldquo;Right. And they don&amp;rsquo;t have money with them, so I&amp;rsquo;m
going to stick with them until they pay me, because I have
debts. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s a good way for me to get out of the way,
because someone might be after me to break my knees or
something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sounds good. Do you have a name?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 2: &amp;ldquo;Mmmmh&amp;hellip; Frankos the Sailor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frankos the Sailor has a small and fast ship.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frankos the Sailor has debts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frankos the Sailor has a contract with Gregorios and Desmondos.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-third-challenger-has-arrived&#34;&gt;A third challenger has arrived&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more adventures, all three characters find themselves
hidden in the hold of Drakon the Undefeated&amp;rsquo;s own ship.
Right on time, Player 3 arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 3: &amp;ldquo;Sorry guys, I told you I&amp;rsquo;d arrive a bit late. Did you
keep me Princess Erikaka, as I asked?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Yes, we did. Player 1, Player 2, can you tell her about
what has happened so far?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 3, now Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;Ok, then it&amp;rsquo;s simple. I&amp;rsquo;m prisoner in that ship!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Tell me more, why are you held prisoner?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m one of the leaders of the Anti-Spartan Legion&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;We decided to call it the Free Company.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;Ok, I&amp;rsquo;m one of the leaders of the Free Company. Also, I got word
from a terrible threat&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Oh, we got that one, too. There&amp;rsquo;s a freewill-wiping spell,
and the Spartan Legion is going to launch it soon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;Er&amp;hellip; right. So, the bad guy&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; General Drakon the Undefeated!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re annoying. No, his boss, The Demagogue, ordered me arrested.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sure. You managed to somehow send a message to General Gregorios before
being arrested, with details about that spell.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erikaia is prisoner in Drakon&amp;rsquo;s ship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erikaia is one of the leaders of the Free Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon the Undefeated&amp;rsquo;s boss is called The Demagogue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erikaia, Desmondos and Frankos manage to remain hidden but General Gregorios
isn&amp;rsquo;t so lucky. He&amp;rsquo;s somehow separated from the PCs, who can only witness
from afar as Drakon the Undefeated shows up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Drakon. You recognize him easily from the description given
by Erikaia. He&amp;rsquo;s strong, he wears a mask, and he seems to be the
same kind of Paladin as General Gregorios.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon the Undefeated wears a mask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon the Undefeated is also some kind of Paladin, like General Gregorios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short battle, General Gregorios is mercilessly executed by Drakon
the Undefeated, while the heroes manage to escape the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon the Undefeated is über-badass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;towards-the-finale&#34;&gt;Towards the finale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/plotonomicon-the-art-of-not-preparing/Lycurgus_of_Sparta.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jacques-Louis David – Lycurgus of Sparta – Public Domain – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankos the Sailor manages to bring Princess Erikaia
and Desmondos to the Free Company. Ensues a discussion on
battle tactics, led by Princess Erikaia and the leader
of the Free Company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;One second, Erikaia. Tell me something about the leader of the Free Company.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s called Myra Medea. Also, she&amp;rsquo;s dressed in white.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myra Medea is the leader of the Free Company&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myra Medea dresses in white&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After debate, the conclusion is that the only way to save
the archipelago is to send several groups of the Free
Company – including the PCs – to board Drakon&amp;rsquo;s ship,
carrying counterspells, hoping that one will be able
to apply one of these counterspells to the pentagram
that will be used to carry out the spell. Of course,
the attack must be launched immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-grand-finale&#34;&gt;The Grand Finale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/plotonomicon-the-art-of-not-preparing/battle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Giovanni Battista Scultori – Battle between the Acheans and the Trojans – Public Domain – Source: Picryl&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big battle ensues. Drakon the Undefeated illustrates his strength
by killing dozens of unnamed NPCs (since Drakon the Undefeated
has been established to be so very powerful, the GM and players
conspire to tell how he always has something more important
to do than chasing the PCs). Eventually, once most friendly NPCs
are dead, Drakon the Undefeated decides to attack the PCs, but
an explosion throws him overboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counterspell is launched, the spell is averted, everybody rejoices,
and Drakon swears revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulation, heroes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for you, reader, you may have realized a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the major NPCs of this story (Drakon, Gregorios, the Demagogue, Myra Medea)
didn&amp;rsquo;t need much in terms of character creation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with a few tricks, the GM managed to entirely avoid character sheets
for these characters;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most of the creation for the characters was actually done by the players,
rather than the GM;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you already know this story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes, did we forgot to mention it? We should thank our actors, who
    came specially from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Episode IV to take the exact same
    roles in this antique variants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke Skywalker (as Desmondos);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Princess Leia (as Princess Erikaia);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi (as General Gregorios);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Darth Vader (as Drakon the Undefeated);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Han Solo (as Frankos the Sailor);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emperor Palpatine (as the Demagogue);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senator Mon Mothma (as Myra Medea);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-spartan-legion-strikes-back&#34;&gt;The Spartan Legion Strikes Back&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/plotonomicon-the-art-of-not-preparing/greece.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Statue of a Greek Soldier – Public Domain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-grand-finale&#34;&gt;Another Grand Finale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is not over, of course. Eventually, Drakon the Undefeated will manage
to trick Princess Erikaia and Frankos the Sailor into a trap and lure Desmondos
the, er, Hoplite of Light into a hopeless fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our example is a Role-Playing Game, this scene may now go two ways. Either it
can become a by-the-book round-by-round combat, or the GM and Players may come
up with something a bit more inventive. In fact, since Drakon is so much stronger
than Desmondos, a by-the-book combat scene would probably be rather boring, with
Desmondos&amp;rsquo; player rolling attack after attack, only for them to be deflected by
a Drakon who could certainly kill Desmondos in a single half-hearted blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s be a little more inventive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;I have bad news for you, Desmondos. Drakon is really, really, really much
stronger than you. You don&amp;rsquo;t stand a chance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Er&amp;hellip; right. Should I create a new character?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Not quite yet. We&amp;rsquo;re going to tell together how you fail to beat Desmondos,
but he won&amp;rsquo;t kill you. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll be captured, as Erikaia and Frankos, or
perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll manage to escape, I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet, but let&amp;rsquo;s face it, you have
no way of actually beating Drakon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Oh, right. Escaping or being captured, sure, that sounds good. Do
I get to pick now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, you can, if you – as a player – have a strong preference, but otherwise,
we&amp;rsquo;ll see as the scene progresses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Sounds good. Should I roll for attacks?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound really useful, but you can describe your attacks, and how
Drakon evades or deflects them. But in fact, this scene is more a conversation
with the swordfighting as a bit of background noise, rather than a traditional
fight scene.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;I run at him, yelling « YOU WILL NEVER GET ME, DRAKON! » while I
attempt to stab him with my spear, but he deflects it effortlessly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM as Drakon: &amp;ldquo;Oh, but I will, young Hoplite. My master, the Demagogue, has
foreseen it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, it would be surprising if this exact dialog took place during a Storytelling
performance or a Writing session, but the reasoning applies just as well to either case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;As I drop my spear and try to go under his shield with my dagger,
« I know that you killed my father ! », but he manages be able to catch
my wrist and force me to drop the dagger.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM as Drakon: &amp;ldquo;Who told you that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Could Gregorios have told me that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM, taking notes: &amp;ldquo;Sure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Gregorios told me, before you murdered him, like the coward you are!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM as Drakon, with a smirk: &amp;ldquo;That old fool lied to you, Desmondos. I AM YOUR FATHER.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gregorios claims that Drakon killed Desmondos&amp;rsquo; father&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon claims that he&amp;rsquo;s Desmondos&amp;rsquo; father&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon claims that the Demagogue has somehow foreseen the capture of Desmondos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time to end the scene, by the way. Are you going to be captured, injured,
are you going to escape?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;I think he actually broke my wrist. Let me draw a card to find out how
I manage to escape.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-22.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;We were fighting close to this gaping hole, right? &lt;strong&gt;Being ready, always&lt;/strong&gt;,
can I have had time to look at the bottom of the hole and realize it communicates
with the sea?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Yep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Then I take one step backwards and drop into the hole. The fall will
certainly hurt me, but I hope that my friends can rescue me in their ship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Very well. When he realizes what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do, Drakon the Undefeated
attemps to grab you, but he&amp;rsquo;s just one tiny instant too late, and by then, you
are already falling down. Falling down is the last thing you remember. You&amp;rsquo;ll
lose consciousness when hitting the water.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;subverting-round-based-combat&#34;&gt;Subverting round-based combat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have done here is subverting the round-based combat (hero acts, bad guys
act, hero acts, bad guys act, &amp;hellip;) dear to many role-playing games, in particular
video games, but also to many action movies and rephrasing this encounter as a conversation
between Desmondos and Drakon. For one thing, the combat would have made no sense,
as Drakon is so much more powerful than Desmondos. In a role-playing game, a combat
scene would have been both frustrating and limiting. Regardless of storytelling
format, making it a conversation made it interesting: the characters exchanged both
threats and informations, moving the plot forwards. While we do not know, at this
stage, whether Drakon is telling the truth, he undoubtedly had a good reason for
his claims. Investigating the relationship between Drakon and Desmondos sounds like
a very nice hook for the next part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, once again, letting the player (or, in other formats, the audience) decide
the rhythm of the fight and the mean of escape of Desmondos both avoid the frustration
of this one-sided fight and setup the means of regaining hope in the rest of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and in a role-playing format, it also means that we still don&amp;rsquo;t need a detailed
character sheet for Drakon the Undefeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll stop the story of Archipelago Wars here, on this apparent defeat of the heroes,
and we leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine just exactly how much
needs to be prepped ahead of time about the characters of this story for Episode VI,
&lt;em&gt;Return of the Hoplite of Light&lt;/em&gt;. Hint: we can get away with the answer &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;things-we-did&#34;&gt;Things we did&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we have rewritten Star Wars to examine a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introducing major characters / Player&amp;rsquo;s Characters &lt;em&gt;into the plot&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introducing antagonists and supporting characters / Non-Player Characters &lt;em&gt;into the plot&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;starting with a bare bones idea of a character and progressively coming up with the details;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turning NPC encounters into obstacles, rather than fights;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoiding character sheets for NPCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that if you have time to create detailed backstories and/or
character sheets ahead of time, and if you enjoy this task, you are of course
welcome to do so. But hey, this is a book about improv – so if you need to
improv, or if you just don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy spending time prepping characters, know that
you can very easily get away without doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we concentrated on NPCs, the techniques introduced here work just as
well for other parts of the story, including places, factions and the plot
itself. We&amp;rsquo;ll see more in further chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So your character needs to find a key, lost somewhere
in the mess left by the previous owner, or perhaps to
pick the lock. Or maybe that piano needs to be moved
into the living room, or you need to find a way through
an opaque bureaucratic process, or to look innocent in front
of a judge, or intimidating in front of a lowly thug.
Or perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re fishing in a river or piloting
your starship or settling a duel with another Musketeer
before the Guards of the Cardinal show up? Or perhaps
your character is an entire religion, attempting to
gain converts in a new land, or a team of medics and
researchers, fighting step by step against an unknown
pandemic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-overcoming/Turk-engraving5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image of a copper engraving from Karl Gottlieb von Windisch&#39;s 1783 book Briefe über den Schachspieler des Hrn. von Kempelen, nebst drei Kupferstichen die diese berühmte Maschine vorstellen. - Public Domain - Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset&lt;/a&gt;,
all these things are called &lt;strong&gt;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;, and are resolved
with a single rule. This rule
determines whether the characters succeed, fail or give
up, and whether their attempt attracts any kind of Complication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting a Challenge is something that only player&amp;rsquo;s characters
do. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss below what happens how to resolve the actions
of non-player character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;rsquo;ll see, meeting a Challenge is a very generic mechanism
which may be used for pretty much any purpose or scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;setting-up-the-challenge-part-1&#34;&gt;Setting up the Challenge, part 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can meet a Challenge, everybody involved needs
to agree on what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do, exactly. This is called
&lt;em&gt;Setting up&lt;/em&gt;. To setup the Challenge, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to answer a
few questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Player&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt; What is the Challenge you&amp;rsquo;re trying to meet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Player&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Means&lt;/strong&gt; How are you trying to meet it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Reach&lt;/strong&gt; How much effect can the character reasonably achieve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Risk&lt;/strong&gt; What kind if risks does this manoeuver entail, even if it succeeds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is typically a (very short) conversation between player and
GM, to put everybody on the same wavelength. While both the Player
and the GM may have opinions on the matter, the Player has the last
word on some of these questions and the GM on others, as indicated above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These answers will be used to determine the &lt;a href=&#34;#setting-up-the-challenge-part-2&#34;&gt;Challenge rank&lt;/a&gt;,
the &lt;a href=&#34;#setting-up-the-challenge-part-2&#34;&gt;Attribute involved&lt;/a&gt;, and later
the &lt;a href=&#34;#outcome-of-a-challenge&#34;&gt;Outcome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Reach and Risk are on two different scales. It is
entirely possible to achieve a lot during a Challenge (meeting
and &lt;em&gt;possibly exceeding&lt;/em&gt; the Reach) while also paying a dire Cost
(meeting and &lt;em&gt;possibly exceeding&lt;/em&gt; the Risk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-chess-match&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight, during a reception at the Ambassador&amp;rsquo;s, an impromptu friendly Chess
match has begun between two well-known grandmasters. In front of a high-society
crowd of onlookers, Lady Buckingham, &lt;strong&gt;Chess Grandmistress of the Highest Society&lt;/strong&gt;
(PC) and Lord Dervon, &lt;strong&gt;Chess Grandmaster and Heir Apparent to the Prime Minister&lt;/strong&gt; (NPC)
will display their skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m opening with simple manoeuvers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Not so fast! What is your objective, here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m going to play chess?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;For fun?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;No, to win!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;So your objective is to win. How far are you willing to go for this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, it is no secret that Lord Dervon wants to sleep with you. If you wish, you could probably use that fact to drop a bomb on him during the conversation, for instance, or strategically show some décolletage, to get him distracted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not really who I am, is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Your call, entirely.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;No, I&amp;rsquo;ll play honestly. On the other hand, you&amp;rsquo;re right that this is a social opportunity, so there will be chatting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Are you trying anything special while chatting?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;No, just friendly conversation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, so what do you think we take this at a leisurly pace? We&amp;rsquo;ll first see how the first few moves go, while you&amp;rsquo;re chatting with Lord Devon, and see how things develop?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;That sounds good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Also, the worst you risk during these first few moves is probably looking – or sounding – like a fool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have the following answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective: Getting a good start on the chess game, while chatting amicably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Means: Counting on Lady Buckinghams&amp;rsquo; chess skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach: The position for the rest of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk: Looking or sounding like a fool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the GM&amp;rsquo;s decision would have been very different if the two characters hadn&amp;rsquo;t both been
Chess grandmasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if only Lady Buckingham had been a grandmaster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) Reach: As much domination as she whants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) Risk: Disappointing the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, if only Lord Devon had been a grandmaster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) Reach: Not being entirely dominated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) Risk:  ocial shame at being toyed with by a grandmaster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll keep our original setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, for this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume that Lady Buckingham has already used
all her Sleeve Cards, so she won&amp;rsquo;t be able to use them during this
Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex, &lt;strong&gt;Action Journalist&lt;/strong&gt;, had been in the attic for hourse, searching the house of the suspect
for clues, when he realized that a fire had started. He now needs to make an exit, hopefully with
some of the evidence he had managed to sort out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;So, I had a big heap of documents somewhere in the attic, which I intended to read more
in details. I&amp;rsquo;ll try and make an exit with these documents.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;You have maybe 10kg worth of papers, without any kind of bag to carry them all. That&amp;rsquo;s tricky.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;Ok, then I&amp;rsquo;ll just grab as many as I can put under my arm, and run to the exit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Alright. That sounds possible. If you succeed well enough, you&amp;rsquo;ll keep an armful of documents.
You might fail, of course, in which case you&amp;rsquo;ll lose some or all of the documents, but the main
risk is not to the documents, it&amp;rsquo;s to you. Because, well, there is a fire in the house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;Fair enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have the following answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective: Leaving the house safely with an armful of documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Means: Running to the exit as fast as possible while keeping documents under my arm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach: Alex should be able to reach the exit with the documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk: Anything that can happen in a fire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the GM agrees with Alex&amp;rsquo; plan and will resolve it all as one meet. The GM could
have decided that the scene deserve more pacing and that Alex would at first only reach the floor
below the attic. This would have decreased the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that the GM mentions &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;we don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re going to meet on your way down&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; – indeed, that&amp;rsquo;s something that will be decided &lt;em&gt;at the end of the Challenge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume that Alex doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any Sleeve Cards at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in Tokyo, today is Wednesday, so a giant monster attacks!
It is called Levinulon, it is taller than the Tokyo General Hospital,
and it is clearly here to destroy as much of the city as it can.
Fortunately, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force &lt;strong&gt;Mechanized Defenders of the City&lt;/strong&gt;
(that&amp;rsquo;s a single PC), in its non-military battle robots, is there to protect the city!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/posts/tourists-conflict-resolution/kaiju.png&#34; alt=&#34;Picture by Wikipedia User D J Shin – My Toy Museum – Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;For the moment, we&amp;rsquo;re taking position and trying to distract Levinulon from any civilian crowds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, how do you do this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;As much as possible, we&amp;rsquo;re using our remote-controntrolled drones, but if it&amp;rsquo;s not sufficient, we&amp;rsquo;re going to make as much noise as possible without endangering civilians. Maybe by throwing cars, or something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Alright. That sounds possible. For the moment, you&amp;rsquo;re not endangering yourselves overmuch. So, it looks like any risk you take will be something like attracting Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s attention a bit too much, too early, or perhaps destroying a few too many things around you. Also, if you succeed, you&amp;rsquo;ll certainly be fighting Levinulon next.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have the following answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective: Focus Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s attention on anything other than civilians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Means: Distracting Levinulon with drones or, if necessary, the mechs themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach: Affecting Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk: Little risk to the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force, but some risk to the city itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only works because the the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force is
equipped to fight Kaijus. Otherwise, the GM would certainly have
minimized the effect that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force
may reasonaby achieve (&amp;ldquo;save a few civilians&amp;rdquo;) and/or increased
the risk (&amp;ldquo;get wiped out in the attempt&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force
doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any Sleeve Cards at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;setting-up-the-challenge-part-2&#34;&gt;Setting up the Challenge, part 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everybody agrees on the nature of the Challenge,
two more questions can be answered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Player&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Attribute&lt;/strong&gt; What Attribute are you using for this purpose?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Rank&lt;/strong&gt; What&amp;rsquo;s the Rank of the Challenge?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Attributes are the 5 Attributes on the character sheet. If you recall, they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rock&lt;/strong&gt; (stability, authority, power, physical strength);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper&lt;/strong&gt; (knowledge, deduction, riches);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blades&lt;/strong&gt; (violence, ability to effect change);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serpent&lt;/strong&gt; (speed, survival, stealth, deception);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknown&lt;/strong&gt; (imagination, intuition, perception).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lower attribute will increase the likelihood that the risks (or worse) will be realized
while attempting to achieve the character&amp;rsquo;s goals, while a higher attribute will decrease
this likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Attribute picked must, of course, match the description of what the character is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranks are defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mythic 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legendary 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epic 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fantastic 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superb 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fair 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mediocre 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a higher Rank will increase the likelihood of either failure or that the risks will
be realized, while a lower Rank will decrease it considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-chess-match-1&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be relying on intelligence and deduction, so that&amp;rsquo;s Paper, which is good, because I have Superb (5) in Paper.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Lord Devon is your peer, so the difficulty will also be Superb (5).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-1&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving fast, which sounds like Serpent, while keeping the papers safely with me, which sounds like Rock. If it&amp;rsquo;s ok, I&amp;rsquo;ll take the highest, which is my Great (4) Rock.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sounds reasonable. As for the fire, since you react quickly, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too difficult for you, so it&amp;rsquo;s a Good (3) rank.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-1&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be relying on fast movement and misdirection, so that&amp;rsquo;s Serpents. I have Great (4) in Serpent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Given Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s size and general taste for mayhem and destruction, attracting his attention might be very difficult. So, let&amp;rsquo;s make it a Superb (4) difficulty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;drawing-cards-and-narrating-progress&#34;&gt;Drawing cards and narrating progress&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-overcoming/cardsharps.png&#34; alt=&#34;Caravaggio – The Cardsharps - Public Domain – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that everything is setup, the next step is to draw cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenge-draws-and-gm-narrates&#34;&gt;Challenge draws and GM narrates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Challenge draws as many cards as its Rank and places them,
face visible, on the table. Orientation of cards matters. This
is typically done by the GM, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a special rule, if the Challenge encounters the Excuse while
drawing, drawing stops at the card before the Excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay special attention to the cards that are reversed. They will be
used to determine the &lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt; of the Challenge. Similarly, any
card drawn by the Challenge may affect the &lt;strong&gt;Effect&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Challenge has drawn, whoever drew for these cards gets
to narrate some of the difficulties encountered by the character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-chess-match-2&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lord Devon represents a Superb (5) challenge, the GM draws 5 cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Lord Devon is obviously in no hurry (&lt;em&gt;Longevity&lt;/em&gt;). He starts slowly, cautiously
following his usual style (&lt;em&gt;Heaven &amp;amp; Hell, the usual game&lt;/em&gt;). What you may or may
not realize in time is that he has a sophisticated trap in mind (&lt;em&gt;Subterfuge&lt;/em&gt;)
against your Queen (&lt;em&gt;Living to Consume&lt;/em&gt;). At the end of this early game, the
trap will have closed and it will be &lt;em&gt;Too late for subterfuges&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-2&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the fire represents a Good (3) challenge, the GM draws 3 cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;For a while, you were busy in the attic, digging through crates of paperworks,
and nothing happened. The attic is full of, well, way too many things. You can find
Japanese artwork (&lt;em&gt;Soldier of Paper&lt;/em&gt;), old movie parapharnelia (&lt;em&gt;Lover of Unknown&lt;/em&gt;),
and tons of things piled haphazardly on top of each other (&lt;em&gt;Failures on top of failures&lt;/em&gt;).
And suddenly, as if coming from nowhere, fire (&lt;em&gt;Sudden power&lt;/em&gt;)!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the GM didn&amp;rsquo;t use the interpretation &lt;em&gt;Underestimating the enemy&lt;/em&gt;, as they couldn&amp;rsquo;t find
    a way to use this without forcing their narration on Alex. Alex&amp;rsquo; player has control
    over his character, so only that player may decide whether Alex did or did not
    underestimate the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-2&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is Superb (4), so the GM draws 4 cards:&lt;/p&gt;

        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This time, the GM decides to take things mostly literally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;By the time you arrive, Levinulon has already destroyed a large subway station
(&lt;em&gt;XI. of Triumph&lt;/em&gt;) and is tearing apart a skyscraper (&lt;em&gt;IV. of Triumph&lt;/em&gt;). Under
its footstep, you can also see the remains of what must have been a brothel
(&lt;em&gt;A truth, uncovered&lt;/em&gt;), full of naked people dead or screaming.
Levinulon simply stepped through it, tearing through as if it had
been paper (&lt;em&gt;Overlooking an obstacle&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;character-draws-and-player-narrates&#34;&gt;Character draws and Player narrates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To beat the challenge, the player will now draw cards for their
character. The challenge is beaten if the player draws cards that
beat all the cards of the Challenge. As the player draws cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the likelihood of beating the Challenge increases;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;Effect&lt;/strong&gt; of beating the Challenge increases;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt; increases, which may prompt the player to stop drawing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player may decide to not draw cards. If this happens, all Cost
is avoided, regardless of the number of reversed cards already drawn
by the Challenge. Unless the challenge had a Rank of 0, this means
that the challenge is not beaten. Also, to provide a manner for the
character to bounce back to initiative, the player draws one
Sleeve Card, to be used after this Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the player decides to draw, they take cards one by one, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Cost starts below 0, at minus the value of the Attribute involved;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before drawing a card, the player may decide to stop;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the card is the Excuse, discard it and stop drawing immediately;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the card is reversed, it increases the Cost;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the Cost is 5, this is a &lt;strong&gt;Wipe Out&lt;/strong&gt;, stop drawing immediately
(you don&amp;rsquo;t want a Wipe Out, ever);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the table has 1 (respectively 2, 3, 4, 5) cards of the same
figure (e.g. 2 Servants, or 2 Lovers, or 2 Dragons, &amp;hellip;), this
increases the Effect to 1 (respectively 2, 3, 4, 5). This includes
both the cards of the character and those of the Challenge. As
Triumphs have no figure, they do not count towards Effect;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after drawing every card, the player narrates their charater&amp;rsquo;s
effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lady Buckingham simply cannot beat this hand, Lady Buckingham&amp;rsquo;s
player decides to not draw. She has lost this round,
but as she hasn&amp;rsquo;t drawn, there is no Cost for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-3&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall, the GM has drawn the following cards for the Furnace:&lt;/p&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 43&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alex is luckier than Lady Buckingham, as all these cards can be beaten.
So far, two cards are reversed. Since Alex has a Great (4) Rock, that&amp;rsquo;s
a Cost of -2 so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex starts drawing&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-44.png&#34;

                alt=&#34;Card number 44, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This card is reversed, so Cost climbs to -1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;Fire quickly spreads everywhere, it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;nightmare&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t beat any of the
cards of the Challenge, so Alex decides to continue drawing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-36.png&#34;

                alt=&#34;Card number 36, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This card is reversed, so the Cost climbs to Mediocre (0). This card is a Paper,
Paper beats Unknown, so the two Unknown cards in the Challenge&amp;rsquo;s hand
are now beaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by &lt;em&gt;paper&lt;/em&gt; and rotting timber (&lt;em&gt;Letting the world rot&lt;/em&gt;).
This is going to get even worse soon!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one more card to beat!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-10.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This card is reversed, again, so the Cost climbs to Average (1). So far, it&amp;rsquo;s a
very minor Cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;At first, I look for an easy way out, a manner of getting out
of there without going through the fire, but no, that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;futile&lt;/em&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;ll need to go through the fire to get out of here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This card is a Triumph, so it beats all the cards of
the Challenge. At this stage, the Challenge is won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at all the cards on the table:&lt;/p&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 36&#34;

        &lt;img

            alt=&#34;Card number 10&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, there are no pairs, so Alex currently has an Effect of Mediocre (1). Most likely,
that means that he&amp;rsquo;ll only have managed to grab a few documents on the way out.
Alex decides to keep drawing, in order to try and increase his Effect, at the
risk of increasing the Cost.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-22.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-22.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 22, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once again a Triumph, but still no pairs, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t increase the Effect.
On the upside, the card is upright, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t increase the Cost,
either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;Fortunately, as an &lt;strong&gt;Action Journalist&lt;/strong&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;always ready&lt;/em&gt; for action.
I bravely step through the fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex continues.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One more Triumph, but still no pairs, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t increase the Effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;As I walk through the furnace, covering my face as well as I can to avoid
breathing toxic fumes, I hear a &lt;em&gt;big bang&lt;/em&gt; somewhere, but I won&amp;rsquo;t let this distract me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex continues.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-58.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ahah, that&amp;rsquo;s a second Builder! That gives Alex one pair. He decides
to stop drawing here, with a Cost of Mediocre (1) and an Effect of Fair (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;In a final display of my trademarked &lt;strong&gt;Action Journalist&lt;/strong&gt; sprinting skill,
I manage to leave the furnace. I end up in the street&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s see in which state.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-3&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall, Levinulon drew:&lt;/p&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 14&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force is Great (4) in Serpents, so starts with a Cost of -4.
Since one card is already reversed, that&amp;rsquo;s now -3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws:&lt;/p&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is greater. Also, Cost increases to -2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;For the moment, it looks like Levinulon hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen us at all, or our drones (&lt;em&gt;Where is Waldo?&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s remains greater. Also, Cost increases to -1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s actually quite humbling. Even in our mechs, we feel like paper dolls in front of this giant (&lt;em&gt;Diminished&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is still greater. Costs remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;To add to the insult, it really looks like Levinulon is having too much &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; destroying these buildings and killing all these people to pay attention to us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is still greater. Cost increases to Mediocre (0).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Also, the very ground is shaking whenever Levinulon takes a step (&lt;em&gt;Unreliable foundations&lt;/em&gt;). Our mechs are built for mobility, which makes us relatively frail. We keep losing our balance and stumbling around as the ground shakes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is still greater. Cost increases to Average (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;We must have turned around Levinulon five or six times, making as much noise as possible, without succeeding at catching his attention (&lt;em&gt;Senseless cycle&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-21.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is finally beaten! Cost increases to Fair (2). There are two Soldiers on the table, so the Effect
is currently Fair (2). The GM informs the player that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force itself is now at some risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Finally, in a very risky move, our Pigeon-Class Mech takes flight above
Levinulon (&lt;em&gt;Taking Flight&lt;/em&gt;) and Levinulon looks at it. I think we caught its attention!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force prioritizes saving citizens to its own survival, the player would like
an Effect of Good (3). For this purpose, the player would need a third Soldier. The player draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-54.png&#34;

                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 54, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cost increases to Good (3), with an Effect still at Fair (2). The GM informs the player that any further reversed card
will start hurting the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Yes, Levinulon looks away from the latest skyscraper
it was destroying (&lt;em&gt;Farewell to the mighty&lt;/em&gt;) and finally focuses upon us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bravely, Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-72.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-72.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 72, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This card alters neither the Cost nor the Effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time for the mechs to show their &lt;em&gt;Polyvalence&lt;/em&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re going to try and
surround him, to ensure that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a single target, and make as much noise as possible to ensure
that he keeps focusing on us!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without fear, Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-32.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-32.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 32, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a second Ruler, so a second pair. This does not influence the Effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Incoming message from the Command Center (&lt;em&gt;Ruler&lt;/em&gt;): &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t get so close,
it can destroy you all easily!&amp;lsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force decides to stop before luck runs out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Tokyo Defense Force has acheived a Fair (2) Effect at a Good (3) Cost.
It could have been worse (the rules are design to make Cost easier to
accumulate than Effect). The player will get a second opportunity to
interpret this result in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;outcome-of-a-challenge&#34;&gt;Outcome of a Challenge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the cards are drawn, the only thing that remains to do is
to narrate the outcome. Typically, most of what happened during
the Challenge has already been narrated, but now is time to conclude
it as a Success or Failure, and to account for Cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule is that the Player is entirely in charge of
narrating the outcome, as long as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact another
player&amp;rsquo;s character – if this happens, you need the agreement
of that other player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when you narrate Effect and
Cost, the GM is in charge of making sure that the description
is roughly proportionate to the Effect and Cost as drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;determining-and-narrating-failure&#34;&gt;Determining and narrating Failure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A character has Failed if at least one card of the Challenge was
not beaten or if the player decided to not draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means, in particular, that a character can simply never fail
a Challenge with a rank of Mediocre (0).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your character has failed, pick some of the cards on the table
and use them to narrate what has happened. If it sounds interesting,
the GM may ask you to write down your Failure as an Aspect, which may
be used later to elaborate on the consequences of this Failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-chess-match-4&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady Buckingham&amp;rsquo;s player chooses to interpret the following cards
picked by Lord Devon:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure

            alt=&#34;Card number 78&#34;
        /&gt;
    
        
        
        
        &lt;img

                    class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-hand-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                    alt=&#34;Card number 39, reversed&#34;
                
                
            
            alt=&#34;Card number 39&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;Lord Devon has managed to trick me.
I should realized that he was using the Calrissian gambit, but unfortunately,
I fell for it. Now, my only way out of his trap is forward. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to
play aggressively from now on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Can you write down an Aspect?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player writes &lt;strong&gt;Tricked by Lord Devon&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Lord Devon and Lady Buckingham will remember what has just happened –
there will be consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as Lady Buckingham conceded the Challenge, she gets to draw one Sleeve Card&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-47.png&#34;

                alt=&#34;Card number 47, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use it for the mid-game of this match, or
anytime after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;determining-and-narrating-success&#34;&gt;Determining and narrating Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If each card drawn by the Challenge is beaten by at least one card
drawn by the player, the Challenge ends in a Success for the
character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-overcoming/Richmond_newsboy_announcing_the_rebel_success.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Richmond newsboy announcing the rebel success!!! – Illus. in: Harper&#39;s Weekly, 1862. – Public Domain – Source: Library of Congress&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to look at the Reach and Effect to determine just how much
the character has managed to achieve. As a general idea, if the
Effect is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great (5) – The character has achieved the best possible result, regardless
of the Reach established before drawing cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good (4) – The character has exceeded the Reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fair (3) – The character has almost achieved the Reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average (2) – The character has roughly achieved half of their Reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mediocre (1) – It&amp;rsquo;s a nominal success, but frankly, nothing was achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player should now pick a few of the cards (typically,
the pair/triple/&amp;hellip; if there is any) and use it to narrate
the Effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Effect and Cost do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cancel out each other,
so you may end up with a Great Effect and an equally
Great Cost for the same Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, if it sounds interesting,
the GM may ask you to write down your Success as an Aspect, which may
be used later to elaborate on the consequences of this Success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-4&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex has succeeded at escaping the Furnace with the following pair:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure

            alt=&#34;Card number 36&#34;
        /&gt;
    
        
        
        
        &lt;img

            alt=&#34;Card number 58&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s an Average (2) Effect, which means that he&amp;rsquo;s achieved roughly
half of what he was attempting to do. This could mean for instance
that Alex hasn&amp;rsquo;t reached the exit yet, or that Alex has lost roughly
half of the documents, or that Alex has only grabbed a handful of
documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;Ok, that&amp;rsquo;s not ideal, but it&amp;rsquo;s still better than nothing.
So, with my great investigation skills, I had actually managed
to find hundreds and hundreds of documents, which I was in the
process of sorting into boxes. When I realized that the house
was on fire, I started grabbing two boxes, one under each arm,
but when I reached the ladder, I figured that I could couldn&amp;rsquo;t
both get these papers down the ladder and save my skin. I decided
that my skin was more important than my investigation, so
I stuffed what I could in my pockets and ran the rest of the
way to the exit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Alex has slightly changed the initial description of
his actions now that he knows the result of the cards. As long
as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the outcome, this is entirely acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Could you write this down as an Aspect?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player writes down &lt;strong&gt;Most of the evidence was destroyed, but a few wads of paper survived.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-best-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace (best possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Alex had succeeded with a Superb (5) Effect, he would have made
it out of the furnace with all the important papers. The furnace
might accidentally even have helped him reveal hidden proofs or
clues – possibly a dead body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-4&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force had, with difficulty, succeeded
with a Fair (2) Effect, with the following pairs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Reach was to affect Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus. Since an Effect
of Fair (2) suggests that the Reach is halfway met, this can
translate to the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force having succeeded,
but not before Levinulon has had the time to kill a large number
of civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;For me, &lt;em&gt;Farewell to the Mighty&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The rule is the same for all&lt;/em&gt;
indicate that Levinulon has destroyed a very important building. Say
the Bank of Japan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;The Reach was about civilians.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Oh, right. Well, while we
were still trying to attrack Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s attention, it stepped
on the building, before they had time to evacuate. There will
be hundreds of casualties, including the President of the Bank
of Japan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s in addition to the subway station, the brothel, etc.?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Yeah. Lots of damage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;You could have done a little less, but it sounds fair. What about
an Aspect?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player writes down an Aspect &lt;strong&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force couldn&amp;rsquo;t
save the Bank of Japan.&lt;/strong&gt; Undoubtedly, there will be consequences at some
point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-best-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack (best possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force had succeeded with a Superb (5) Effect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in that case, it would immediately have attracted the attention of Levinulon.
Moreover, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force would certainly have found a way to
neutralize Levinulon as a threat, possibly by managing to lead it out of Tokyo,
or to move the fight underwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-chess-match-best-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match (best possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if Lady Buckingham had succeeded with a Superb (5) Effect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in that case, she would have clearly dominated the early game – possibly
with an early checkmate, if the player decided. Also, since such a large
Effect gives the player the ability to considerably exceed the Reach, she
would have managed to further whatever objective she had for this evening.
Perhaps, during the idle chat, she could have managed to slip information
meant to be heard by the right persons, starting the appropriate
high-society rumor, or she could have gotten Lord Devon to accidentally
divulge a secret of interest to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;determining-and-narrating-cost&#34;&gt;Determining and narrating Cost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you succeeded or failed, it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at the Risk
and Cost to determine just how much the character has suffered from this
Challenge. As a general idea, if the Cost is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great (5) – The worst thing that could happen to the characters in the context
has happened, regardless of what Risk was established before drawing the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good (4) – The cost exceeds the Risk established before drawing
the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fair (3) – The cost is not quite as bad as the Risk established before drawing the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average (2) – The cost is roughly half of the Risk established before drawing the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mediocre (1) – The cost is minor and temporary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that players can decide to stop their draw whenever they want, so Costs
of Good or Great will be extremely rare, and even Costs of Fair will be uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-chess-match-5&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady Buckingham conceded the Challenge without drawing cards, so
she incurs no Cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-overcoming/Benjamin_Franklin_playing_chess.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lady Howe mating Benjamin Franklin – Public Domain – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-chess-match-worst-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match (worst possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Lady Buckingham had suffered a Great (5) cost, regardless of winning
or losing, she would somehow have passed for a fool in front of a
crowd of her peers. The player would have narrative control to decide
exactly how this would have happened, and whether Lady Buckingham is
responsible or simply a victim of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, people in the crowd could have started gossiping about
her highly improper – and possibly entirely imaginary – flirt with
Lord Sussex, or her pregnancy. Or could have received a
message that a certain Scotland Yard detective was waiting for her
in the antechamber, along with a few bobbies dispatched to arrest
her. Or she could have been drunk and making improper jokes while
playing chess, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, none of this happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-5&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, Alex suffers a Cost of 1, which is barely worth
mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player looks at one of the reversed cards&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-44.png&#34;

        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m getting out of this fire alive, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be having nightmares
for nights to come!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sounds about fair. Could you write down this as a temporary Aspect
for me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex writes down &lt;strong&gt;Nightmares on Fire&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-worst-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace (worst possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Alex had suffered a Cost of 5, he would not have died in the furnace,
as his draw was successful. However, he might have collapsed in the street,
poisoned by the toxic fumes, and spent the next two years in an hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, he could have made it out of the fire only to be shot by whoever
had started this fire. Or only to receive a phone call from his editor
informing him that he was let go for unspecified reasons. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the player gets to narrate a worst case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-5&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has suffered from a Good (3) Cost, with
the following reversed cards&lt;/p&gt;

        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Risk was: &amp;ldquo;Little risk to the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force, but some risk to the city itself.&amp;rdquo; –
as mentioned by the GM, with a Good (3) Cost, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force
actually suffers from this Cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;Unreliable Foundations&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Farewell to the Mighty&lt;/em&gt;,
so that sounds like buildings collapsing. We&amp;rsquo;ve already covered some of that. There has been
considerable destruction, not just the Bank of Japan. I also see &lt;em&gt;Overlooking an
Obstacle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diminished&lt;/em&gt; – that sounds like one of my drivers was hiding behind one of the
buildings that was destroyed, and didn&amp;rsquo;t get out in time. So one of the mechs is severely
damaged, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if he&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make it for the rest of the event.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Can you write me down an Aspect?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player writes down &lt;strong&gt;One severely damaged mech&lt;/strong&gt;. This will undoubtedly serve later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-worst-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack (worst possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a Great (5) Cost, the Challenge could have covered a much longer period of time,
with the mechs desperately attempting to attract the attention of Levinulo before he
could destroy too much of Tokyo. Since the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has succeeded,
a large part of Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s population would have had time to escape, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, much of the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force would have been damaged or destroyed
in the process, rendering the entire force unusable against Levinulon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you have seen, the rules cover only the case of a PC attempting an action.
This is by design: while it is often fun for players to draw cards, take risks
or play it safe, and see what happens to their characters, the GM is expected
to be impartial and to handle the entire world, which makes notions such as
risks and effects redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if a NPC attempts an action on a non-consenting PC, in N-Dimensional
Tourists, this will simply be handled as a PC Challenging the NPC&amp;rsquo;s action.
The rules are identical and the PC is till the one meeting the Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a NPC attempts to do something on another NPC, rules are neither particularly
necessary nor particularly interesting. The GM is encouraged to either decide the
results, possibly drawing a card for inspiration, or ask one of the players to
draw a card and decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sometimes-it-s-not-a-challenge&#34;&gt;Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s not a Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting a Challenge in N-Dimensional Tourist is not exactly the same process
as resolving an action in most Role-Playing Games. For one thing, it involves
Risks. Also, high levels of Cost or Effect can have a profound impact on the
story itself. Also, setting up a Conflict, then drawing and interpreting an
unbounded number of cards simply takes more time and effort of imagination
than rolling a die and getting a quick answer. That&amp;rsquo;s probably not something
you want to happen whenever a character is opening a door, climbing stairs or
having lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a GM, whenever a character is doing something, before setting up a
Challenge, you need to decide whether this action actually deserves a
Challenge. As a general guideline, if the action involves no interesting
reasonable consequences (Risk or Reach), don&amp;rsquo;t make it a Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;risks-costs-vs-reach-effect&#34;&gt;Risks/Costs vs. Reach/Effect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between the Reach and the Risk and
setup a Challenge in such a manner that a high Cost will not contradict a high
Effect. If you encounter such a case, the simplest solution is to assume:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it&amp;rsquo;s within the control of the character, it&amp;rsquo;s a Reach/Effect;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it&amp;rsquo;s without the control of the character, it&amp;rsquo;s a Risk/Cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the example of the Chess Match, Lady Buckingham can, to
some extent, control what happens on the chessboard and in the conversation
between her and Lord Devon, but not what gossip may be circulating in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by no means the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way of designing Risk vs. Reach or
Cost vs. Effect, but in our experience, it works when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weapons-armors-and-superpowers&#34;&gt;Weapons, armors and superpowers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-conflict-resolution/party.png&#34; alt=&#34;Photo by Wikipedia user William Tung – Cosplay of DC Comics characters at San Diego Comic Con 2015. – Licensed under CC-BY-SA 2.0 – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many games, weapons, armors, superpowers and other manners of affecting
the universe have dedicated rules. In N-Dimensional Tourists, they are typically
considered instances of Aspects, either temporary or permanent. As such, they
provide narrative authorization for characters to accomplish things that they would
not have been able to accomplish otherwise, and they can be affected by
Sleeve Cards, but they have no special rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the Kaiju Attack, the mechs are part of &lt;strong&gt;Mechanized Defenders of the City&lt;/strong&gt;.
As such, they authorize the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force to go head-to-head against
Levinulon. They do not otherwise affect the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some equipment is absolutely central to your character, you may make it a Specialty,
and customize the rule. In effect, this equipment will become part of your character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wounds-traumas-and-social-consequences&#34;&gt;Wounds, Traumas and Social Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many games have rules to represent the health of a character. In N-Dimensional Tourists,
there are no such rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your character is doing something particularly risky (as established by the Risk)
or takes too many chances while doing it (as established by the Cost), they may be
wounded, or traumatized, or shunned out of polite society, or sentenced to jail,
or any other kind of heavy consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all (negative) Aspects. Depending on the gravity of the Aspect, it may be
simple to get rid of it, harder, or even entirely impossible. Differences between
such aspects exists entirely in-story and not covered by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;death&#34;&gt;Death&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as there are no specific rules for health, there are no rules for Death. While
the threat of Death can make for an interesting story, we feel that Death itself is
generally not interesting enough that it deserves special rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a character has to die because it makes sense in the story, then let it happen.
Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because the character was Wiped Out in a Challenge that involved a
clear risk of Death. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because of a heroic sacrifice, or something that
had been decided by the player for some time. In either case, we believe that
Death is nothing that requires special rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, exceptions. You may be playing in a setting which allows the
game to continue past Death, in which case Death becomes simply part of the story,
possibly a simple Aspect. If you are playing in such a setting, you may want to come
up with rules – or at least agreements – on how to handle Death, Afterlife,
Resurrection, Ghosts, Undead and the like. If so, your agreement will be highly
specific to your setting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Plotonomicon: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/plotonomicon-tutorial/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 23:26:01 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;You know what? Let&amp;rsquo;s keep explanations for later. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with some action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine cars racing in the streets of Rio de Janeiro. It&amp;rsquo;s the present. Two of the heroes (let&amp;rsquo;s call them Desmond and Erika) share a sportscar, driving as fast as they can away from the HQ of Evil Corporation, where they just stole a USB stick. Our third hero (Frank) is in the gadget van, driving more slowly while keeping an eye on a map of traffic lights. A dozen of armed thugs on motorcycles are after Desmond and Erika. Also, imagine you have never visited Rio de Janeiro, you have no clue what the city looks like, and you haven&amp;rsquo;t prepped this pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/plotonomicon/tutorial-car-chase.png&#34; alt=&#34;Flickr user Alan Levin – Car Chase – Licensed under CC BY 2.0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No problem. For one thing, we don&amp;rsquo;t actually care what the city looks like – it&amp;rsquo;s just a game, and you&amp;rsquo;re not going to get it any more wrong than most Hollywood movies. So let&amp;rsquo;s see what we can do to make it fun. If you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; live in Rio de Janeiro, just imagine it&amp;rsquo;s Istanbul instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;setting-up-the-scene&#34;&gt;Setting up the scene&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s add initial flavour to the encounter. Is it warm? Rainy? Is there a demonstration or a festival today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s ask the Space·Time Deck. Alice draws, asking &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;What is happening in the streets of Rio today?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-22.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-22.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 22, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On this card, we see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A number, XVII.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A name &amp;ldquo;Planning for retirement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An interpretation &amp;ldquo;Being ready, always&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A picture, with many terracota soldiers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only one interpretation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each card has two interpretations, but we only ever look at the one facing us. Trust us, this adds more
variety to the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the picture and the interpretation, Alice, our GM, now declares &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Apparently, there are many soldiers in the streets. You are not sure why, but it looks like an entire batallion is being redeployed today.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, let&amp;rsquo;s go further &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Circulation on the main streets is quite complicated. There are columns of armored vehicles on the avenues and trucks full of young soldiers waiting at the red lights. People don&amp;rsquo;t seem particularly alarmed, so you can only assume that this is either a common occurrence or something that people expected.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since Alice intended to add some flavour, not ruin the pursuit, she adds &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Frank, since you have been here for hours, if you wish, you may have mapped an escape route that avoids the military.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this draw, Alice has gained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an overarching threat for both Desmond + Erika and for Frank (let&amp;rsquo;s not get shot by soldiers);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strategic choices during the pursuit (the PCs could decide to get close to the soldiers, or even to disguise themselves as soldiers and board a truck);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some background information that may be reused after the pursuit (people were expecting a military redeployment today, why?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lest anybody forgets, Alice writes these &lt;strong&gt;Facts&lt;/strong&gt; on a piece of paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soldiers everywhere in the streets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody seems worried by the soldiers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large streets are pretty much blocked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pursuit may now start. For this, Alice is going to use the usual rules provided by her ruleset, so we&amp;rsquo;re not going to give all the details about the pursuit. If you want Space·Time Deck-based rules for the pursuit, either because you&amp;rsquo;re Charlene the Writer, or because you just want to try something different, you can take a look at the mini-rules included in the deck, or at the sister book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;waking-up-sleeping-players&#34;&gt;Waking up sleeping players&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three or four rounds into the pursuit, Alice realizes that Frank&amp;rsquo;s player is getting bored. Desmond and Erika are getting all the actions, while Frank is just giving directions from his van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s spice things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Frank, trouble is heading your way. While you were concentrating on helping Desmond and Erika, you didn&amp;rsquo;t realize something&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frank: &amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Draw a card and tell me what kind of trouble is coming for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-78.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-78.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 78, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On this card, we see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Suit symbol, representing the Serpent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Figure symbol, representing the Treasure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A name: &amp;ldquo;Be careful, it can make sparks&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An interpretation: &amp;ldquo;Caution needed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A picture, with two serious-looking men carefully looking at a salamander, without realizing that their background is burning already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at &amp;ldquo;Caution needed&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Be careful, it can make sparks&amp;rdquo;, Frank&amp;rsquo;s player decides that soldiers are being extra cautious around his van today. Actually, looking at the fire on the picture, there are probably canine patrols sniffing around and getting close to the van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank answers &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;I believe that a patrol of soldiers with dogs is inspecting all the cars parked in the street. They&amp;rsquo;re probably checking for bombs, because an official is going to come this way. They&amp;rsquo;re a few cars away from me.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Frank&amp;rsquo;s player, just like Alice, doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to interpret the cards alone. There is absolutely no problem with asking around the table for suggestions. Since Frank&amp;rsquo;s player is drawing, he&amp;rsquo;ll be the one picking the final interpretation.
Of course, as GM, Alice gets to decide whether Frank&amp;rsquo;s interpretation makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this draw, we have additional &lt;strong&gt;Facts&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canine patrols are looking for bombs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An official is coming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Frank needs to react quickly. He may decide to keep his cool, or to ditch the van. He&amp;rsquo;s probably going to be unavailable for a few rounds, too, so Desmond and Erika won&amp;rsquo;t benefit from Frank&amp;rsquo;s help – so Alice may inform the players that they have a malus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On we go, with the pursuit and the canine patrols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;keeping-things-interesting&#34;&gt;Keeping things interesting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some chases work nicely, but others can end up uninteresting. Apparently, about twenty minutes later, this is starting to be the case here. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we can do to liven things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Desmond, Erika, something is going to force you to change tactics. Tell me what!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erika&amp;rsquo;s player draws a card.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-17.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-17.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 17, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On this card, we see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A number: XII.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A name: &amp;ldquo;Playing Protector&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An interpretation: &amp;ldquo;Feeling defenceless&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A picture, with some kind of winged hero attacking a winged monster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A player doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to interpret a card alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmond: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Playing protector&amp;rsquo;, so it&amp;rsquo;s related to the army. Possibly some armor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erika: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Feeling defenceless&amp;rsquo;, so it&amp;rsquo;s something against which we have no defense. Maybe air support?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmond: &amp;ldquo;Well, if it&amp;rsquo;s air support, the military is bound to react, unless it&amp;rsquo;s their air support.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d rather avoid having the entire army against you, if that&amp;rsquo;s ok with you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erika: &amp;ldquo;I know, maybe some genius from the Evil Corporation has managed to hack the communications of the army, and they&amp;rsquo;re trying to convince helicopters to shoot at us. And we know about that – and we feel defenceless – because Frank is getting all the chatter from his van.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;That sounds good. Frank, I think that you&amp;rsquo;re the only one who can do anything about that. Also, since you&amp;rsquo;re the hacker here, you get to name the Evil Corporation hacker.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frank: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll call him&amp;hellip; no, I&amp;rsquo;ll call her Lady Shadowcat! And I&amp;rsquo;ll get immediately to try and hack her while she&amp;rsquo;s hacking the army!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmond: &amp;ldquo;And since we hear about it, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to find a way to avoid being visible from the skies. So Frank, can you lead us through some crowded bazar or mall or subway or something?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frank: &amp;ldquo;Hey, give me a minute, I&amp;rsquo;m running interference for you, I&amp;rsquo;m only one man!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice adds the following Facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lady Shadowcat, genius Evil Corporation hacker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The army may decide to look after Desmond + Erika.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty soon, the pursuit is going to continue in the subway of Rio – are there subways in Rio de Janeiro? That&amp;rsquo;s not important for an Hollywood action chase! (If you wonder: yes, Rio de Janeiro has 3 subway lines.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;ending-the-scene&#34;&gt;Ending the scene&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, time will come to end the chase. This ending may come up naturally, if the players have managed to get rid of their pursuit, or if they have been overtaken. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s much better to end the scene without waiting for boredom to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice: &amp;ldquo;The pursuit is ending. I&amp;rsquo;ll draw to find out how.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;assets/small_reversed_card_12.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-17.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-17.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 17, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hey, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen that card already. No matter, since we&amp;rsquo;re asking a different question, we&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a different use for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this card, we (still) see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A number: XII.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A name: &amp;ldquo;Playing Protector&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An interpretation: &amp;ldquo;Rescue is coming&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A picture, with some kind of winged hero attacking a winged monster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &amp;ldquo;Rescue is coming&amp;rdquo;, Alice decides that, well, rescue is coming. From &amp;ldquo;Playing Protector&amp;rdquo;, she decides that the rescue will be impressive. And looking at the wings, she concludes that it will come from the air. Since there are &lt;strong&gt;Soldiers everywhere in the streets&lt;/strong&gt;, it should be an helicopter from an airborn unit of the army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice then narrates &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;You drive up the stairways like madpeople, hoping that the bikes&amp;rsquo; wheels won&amp;rsquo;t be as stable as yours. Eventually, you reach the exit, where you hear a chopper, very close to your position. Looking up, you see a military deployment vehicle getting ready to drop shock troopers. Suddenly, the silence on your radio is broken by the voice of Archangel, your boss: &amp;lsquo;Prepare to ditch the car and board the helicopter. It will lead you to a safe place.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, since &lt;strong&gt;An official is coming&lt;/strong&gt;, Alice suspects that the players are going to meet that official very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-did-we-do&#34;&gt;What did we do?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little help, an unprepped urban chase scene came up pretty memorable. Just as importantly, once the players encounter the official, all the military deployment and bomb-sniffing dogs will have been turned into &lt;em&gt;foreshadowing&lt;/em&gt; – even though Frank was the one who introduced the canine squads in the first place. Similarly, Lady Shadowcat who is at best a faceless opponent is this scene is going to return, at some point, again turning Frank&amp;rsquo;s introduction into foreshadowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s summarize the techniques we have used so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up the scene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking questions that will help you make the scene fun to play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawing and interpreting from the Space·Time Deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing down key facts as they were established.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reusing these facts when they become useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaking things by letting players pick plot twists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpreting ideas collaboratively.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>The Plotonomicon: The Space Time Deck</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/plotonomicon-space-time-deck/</link>

      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/plotonomicon-space-time-deck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is a deck of 67 cards and a few blanks, loosely inspired
from Tarot decks, and designed to aid with story improv, including
Role-Playing Games and other forms of Storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the cards is designed to be interpreted on its own, and to be used
as part of a narrative role-playing ruleset. For both reasons, cards
have both illustrations and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is used throughout &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/plotonomicon&#34;&gt;the Plotonomicon&lt;/a&gt;
for building plots, characters, places, factions, twists, etc. and
throughout &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;the N-Dimensional Tourists&lt;/a&gt;
as a base for resolving obstacles, conflicts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-cards&#34;&gt;Why cards?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason to use cards is that they are a natural support
for improv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, in story improv, you should be able to use anything
around you as support for improvisation, anything you see or hear
or remember. In fact, the patron saint of improvisers is &lt;em&gt;Usual Suspects&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lsquo;
Keyser Söze, who manages to come up with a plot twist just by
looking at his coffee cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, most of us aren&amp;rsquo;t Keyser Söze. We have ideas, many of them,
all the time, but we typically have so many of them tha it&amp;rsquo;s hard
for us to pick one, focus on it, and develop it until it actually
becomes a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at one card is one way to focus your thoughts, for just
a few seconds, by forcing yourself to express your thoughts in
relationship to this card. Focus helps you pick one single idea
from the mass teeming in your brain, which
is what you need to make that story interesting and fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason for which we use cards is specific to gaming
and resolving obstacles or conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most role-playing games use dice for the purpose of resolving
obstacles or conflicts, and dice, once rolled, have a very limited
set of interpretations – typically only a number and a color.
Using cards that support open-ended interpretations gives us
much more freedom to build a story upon the workings of this
resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;composition&#34;&gt;Composition&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck consists in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Cards of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/suit-rock&#34;&gt;Rock Suit&lt;/a&gt;, unnumbered + 2 blanks – may symbolize stability, authority, power, physical strength, society, but also rigidity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Cards of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/suit-paper&#34;&gt;Paper Suit&lt;/a&gt;, unnumbered + 2 blanks – may symbolize knowledge, deduction, riches, but also fragility;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Cards of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/suit-blades&#34;&gt;Blades Suit&lt;/a&gt;, unnumbered + 2 blanks – may symbolize forced change, violence and death;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Cards of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/suit-serpent&#34;&gt;Serpent Suit&lt;/a&gt;, unnumbered + 2 blanks – may symbolize speed, stealth, adaptation, survival but also lies, forbidden knowledge, forbidden power, temptation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Cards of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/suit-out-there&#34;&gt;Unknown Suit&lt;/a&gt;, unnumbered + 2 blanks – may symbolize imagination, intuition, perception, dreams, illusions, but also the unability to distinguish between facts and fiction;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21 &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/post/the-space-time-deck/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Triumph Cards&lt;/a&gt;, numbered I to XXI, + 5 blanks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/post/the-space-time-deck/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Excuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each suit consists in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-ruler.png)&#34;&gt;a Ruler – may symbolize the power of taking decisions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-dragon.png)&#34;&gt;a Dragon – the guardian of either the Ruler or the Treasure, and may symbolize the last, greatest obstacle in a quest;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-treasure.png)&#34;&gt;a Treasure – may symbolize that which you are seeking, whether riches, or knowledge, or peace, or anything else;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-soldier.png)&#34;&gt;a Soldier – may symbolize doing bad things on behalf of the Ruler, abandoning free will;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-builder.png)&#34;&gt;a Builder – may symbolize the power of creation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-seeker.png)&#34;&gt;a Seeker – may symbolize the will of pursuing a quest;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-lover.png)&#34;&gt;a Lover – may symbolize both desire and unity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-servant.png)&#34;&gt;a Servant – may symbolize forced obedience;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-home.png)&#34;&gt;a Home – may symbolize your origin;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-mover.png)&#34;&gt;a Mover (blank) – may symbolize travel;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-child.png)&#34;&gt;a Child (blank) – may symbolize innocence;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blanks are designed to be customized. Add your characters,
places or factions or cosmic powers of importance
in your campaign, or anything that you believe matters,
as and when you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a professionally printed copy of the
Space·Time Deck and plan to use the deck for several campaigns,
you probably want to use unstickable stickers/sticky notes
for customization. Or, simply, got to your local RPG shop
and buy card protectors for all your cards, to make sure
that they cannot be distinguished at first sight, then
go ahead and print out custom cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for whenever you need to determine if a card
somehow beats another one, there is a universal rule:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-4.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-4.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-horizontal-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 4, horizontal&#34;
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up on the diagram, it&amp;rsquo;s a stalemate)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cards&#34;&gt;Cards&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each card consists in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an Illustration;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Title;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an upright Interpretation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a reversed Interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suit cards also contain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Suit symbol;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Figure symbol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the Suit symbol or the Figure symbol may be in complete contradition with the Illustration, Title or Interpretations – or related only by the thinest of threads, possibly just a joke. If you are familiar with Tarot, you may find this surprising. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, this is by design: cards are there to provide starting blocks for improv, and to fit in open-ended stories with multiple narratives, not to force players into a single interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;interpreting-a-card&#34;&gt;Interpreting a card&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cards are good at helping you come up with answers to specific questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does the Demagogue say in her speech?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why didn&amp;rsquo;t the police arrive in time?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What caused the plague?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does the monster look like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How does the engine breakdown?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a question, draw one card – orientation matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-a-triumph&#34;&gt;Example: A Triumph&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting: Cyberpunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: &amp;ldquo;Who will the Syndicate send after the heroes?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draw: 
&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-10.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-10.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 10, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s now start observing things on the card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the picture, a monster with the face of a woman (namely, the Sphinx of Thebes). So, let&amp;rsquo;s go for simplicity and decide that the assassin is a heavily modified woman. The Sphinx appears calm and in control of the situation, so let&amp;rsquo;s assume the same for the assassin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interpretation facing us is &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The futility of running away from destiny&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. This can mean that the assassin is going to catch up with the heroes, regardless of what they do. Or, it could mean that this assassin is someone that the heroes already know and whom they have avoided so far. Let&amp;rsquo;s go for both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back to the picture, the monster and the young man (namely, Oedipus) seem to be embracing each other. So, let&amp;rsquo;s add to this the fact that the monster and one of the heroes are or have been lovers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still on the picture, a hand rising from a grave. There&amp;rsquo;s someone dead or dying between the heroes and the assassin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The card is reversed, so all of this is probably bad news for the heroes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the way, we already have a name for the assassin: &amp;ldquo;The Sphinx&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the heroes do not have any such character in their backstory, it&amp;rsquo;s ok – backstories are highly malleable, so it is high time to ask one of them if they would please tell us more about their past love relationship with The Sphinx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, other ways to interpret the card, and that&amp;rsquo;s entirely ok. Just pick one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-a-suit&#34;&gt;Example: A Suit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting: High Fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: &amp;ldquo;What do the heroes find on the way to the Temple of Unlimited Horror?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draw: 
&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-66.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-66.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 66, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s now start observing the card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the picture, some kind of oddly-shaped dragon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still on the picture, the dragon seems to have lost most of their HPs. So, let&amp;rsquo;s say that the heroes will encounter a gravely wounded dragon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dragon is apparently fighting a child with a large sword. Let&amp;rsquo;s interpret this to mean that some irresponsible warrior has decided to kill the dragon, regardless of consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interpretation &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Nope, the sword is mightier&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; could mean that this is all some kind of bet. So, maybe the warrior is trying to kill all the dragons in the region, just to make some kind of point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The card is also a Dragon Figure, so it may also be considered some kind of guardian. For some reason, the warrior and his retinue are obstacles on the road towards the Temple. Perhaps they have blockaded a road or an area that the heroes need to cross to reach the Temple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here we go: in the course of the weeks that it takes them to travel to the Temple, the heroes find a trail of dead or dying dragon and dragon-like creatures, good and evil alike. They have all been hunted down by a young, irresponsible nobleman and his personal guard. This is the kind of action that will have bad, very bad consequences for the future of the entire kingdom. Also, in a more immediate matter, the personal guard of the nobleman is on the path of the heroes, and is going to prevent the heroes from progressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of bad consequences will the slaughter have? How are the personal guards going to cause problems for the heroes? Well, that sounds like questions for more cards!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

places or factions or cosmic powers of importance
in your campaign, or anything that you believe matters,
as and when you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a professionally printed copy of the
Space·Time Deck and plan to use the deck for several campaigns,
you probably want to use unstickable stickers/sticky notes
for customization. Or, simply, got to your local RPG shop
and buy card protectors for all your cards, to make sure
that they cannot be distinguished at first sight, then
go ahead and print out custom cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for whenever you need to determine if a card
somehow beats another one, there is a universal rule:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-4.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-4.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-horizontal-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 4, horizontal&#34;
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up on the diagram, it&amp;rsquo;s a stalemate)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cards&#34;&gt;Cards&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each card consists in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an Illustration;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Title;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an upright Interpretation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a reversed Interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suit cards also contain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Suit symbol;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Figure symbol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the Suit symbol or the Figure symbol may be in complete contradition with the Illustration, Title or Interpretations – or related only by the thinest of threads, possibly just a joke. If you are familiar with Tarot, you may find this surprising. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, this is by design: cards are there to provide starting blocks for improv, and to fit in open-ended stories with multiple narratives, not to force players into a single interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;interpreting-a-card&#34;&gt;Interpreting a card&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cards are good at helping you come up with answers to specific questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does the Demagogue say in her speech?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why didn&amp;rsquo;t the police arrive in time?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What caused the plague?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does the monster look like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How does the engine breakdown?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a question, draw one card – orientation matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-a-triumph&#34;&gt;Example: A Triumph&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting: Cyberpunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: &amp;ldquo;Who will the Syndicate send after the heroes?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draw: 
&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-10.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-10.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 10, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s now start observing things on the card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the picture, a monster with the face of a woman (namely, the Sphinx of Thebes). So, let&amp;rsquo;s go for simplicity and decide that the assassin is a heavily modified woman. The Sphinx appears calm and in control of the situation, so let&amp;rsquo;s assume the same for the assassin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interpretation facing us is &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The futility of running away from destiny&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. This can mean that the assassin is going to catch up with the heroes, regardless of what they do. Or, it could mean that this assassin is someone that the heroes already know and whom they have avoided so far. Let&amp;rsquo;s go for both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back to the picture, the monster and the young man (namely, Oedipus) seem to be embracing each other. So, let&amp;rsquo;s add to this the fact that the monster and one of the heroes are or have been lovers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still on the picture, a hand rising from a grave. There&amp;rsquo;s someone dead or dying between the heroes and the assassin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The card is reversed, so all of this is probably bad news for the heroes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the way, we already have a name for the assassin: &amp;ldquo;The Sphinx&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the heroes do not have any such character in their backstory, it&amp;rsquo;s ok – backstories are highly malleable, so it is high time to ask one of them if they would please tell us more about their past love relationship with The Sphinx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, other ways to interpret the card, and that&amp;rsquo;s entirely ok. Just pick one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-a-suit&#34;&gt;Example: A Suit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting: High Fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: &amp;ldquo;What do the heroes find on the way to the Temple of Unlimited Horror?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draw: 
&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-66.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-66.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 66, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s now start observing the card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the picture, some kind of oddly-shaped dragon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still on the picture, the dragon seems to have lost most of their HPs. So, let&amp;rsquo;s say that the heroes will encounter a gravely wounded dragon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dragon is apparently fighting a child with a large sword. Let&amp;rsquo;s interpret this to mean that some irresponsible warrior has decided to kill the dragon, regardless of consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interpretation &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Nope, the sword is mightier&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; could mean that this is all some kind of bet. So, maybe the warrior is trying to kill all the dragons in the region, just to make some kind of point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The card is also a Dragon Figure, so it may also be considered some kind of guardian. For some reason, the warrior and his retinue are obstacles on the road towards the Temple. Perhaps they have blockaded a road or an area that the heroes need to cross to reach the Temple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here we go: in the course of the weeks that it takes them to travel to the Temple, the heroes find a trail of dead or dying dragon and dragon-like creatures, good and evil alike. They have all been hunted down by a young, irresponsible nobleman and his personal guard. This is the kind of action that will have bad, very bad consequences for the future of the entire kingdom. Also, in a more immediate matter, the personal guard of the nobleman is on the path of the heroes, and is going to prevent the heroes from progressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of bad consequences will the slaughter have? How are the personal guards going to cause problems for the heroes? Well, that sounds like questions for more cards!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Space Time Deck</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/space-time-deck/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 13:45:25 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/space-time-deck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is a deck of 67 cards and a few blanks, loosely inspired
from Tarot decks, and designed to aid with story improv, including
Role-Playing Games and other forms of Storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the cards is designed to be interpreted on its own, and to be used
as part of a narrative role-playing ruleset. For both reasons, cards
have both illustrations and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is used throughout &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/plotonomicon&#34;&gt;the Plotonomicon&lt;/a&gt;
for building plots, characters, places, factions, twists, etc. and
throughout &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;the N-Dimensional Tourists&lt;/a&gt;
as a base for resolving obstacles, conflicts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-cards&#34;&gt;Why cards?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason to use cards is that they are a natural support
for improv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, in story improv, you should be able to use anything
around you as support for improvisation, anything you see or hear
or remember. In fact, the patron saint of improvisers is &lt;em&gt;Usual Suspects&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lsquo;
Keyser Söze, who manages to come up with a plot twist just by
looking at his coffee cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, most of us aren&amp;rsquo;t Keyser Söze. We have ideas, many of them,
all the time, but we typically have so many of them tha it&amp;rsquo;s hard
for us to pick one, focus on it, and develop it until it actually
becomes a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at one card is one way to focus your thoughts, for just
a few seconds, by forcing yourself to express your thoughts in
relationship to this card. Focus helps you pick one single idea
from the mass teeming in your brain, which
is what you need to make that story interesting and fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason for which we use cards is specific to gaming
and resolving obstacles or conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most role-playing games use dice for the purpose of resolving
obstacles or conflicts, and dice, once rolled, have a very limited
set of interpretations – typically only a number and a color.
Using cards that support open-ended interpretations gives us
much more freedom to build a story upon the workings of this
resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;composition&#34;&gt;Composition&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck consists in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Cards of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/suit-rock&#34;&gt;Rock Suit&lt;/a&gt;, unnumbered + 2 blanks – may symbolize stability, authority, power, physical strength, society, but also rigidity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Cards of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/suit-paper&#34;&gt;Paper Suit&lt;/a&gt;, unnumbered + 2 blanks – may symbolize knowledge, deduction, riches, but also fragility;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Cards of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/suit-blades&#34;&gt;Blades Suit&lt;/a&gt;, unnumbered + 2 blanks – may symbolize forced change, violence and death;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Cards of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/suit-serpent&#34;&gt;Serpent Suit&lt;/a&gt;, unnumbered + 2 blanks – may symbolize speed, stealth, adaptation, survival but also lies, forbidden knowledge, forbidden power, temptation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Cards of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/suit-out-there&#34;&gt;Unknown Suit&lt;/a&gt;, unnumbered + 2 blanks – may symbolize imagination, intuition, perception, dreams, illusions, but also the unability to distinguish between facts and fiction;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21 &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/post/the-space-time-deck/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Triumph Cards&lt;/a&gt;, numbered I to XXI, + 5 blanks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/post/the-space-time-deck/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Excuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each suit consists in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-ruler.png)&#34;&gt;a Ruler – may symbolize the power of taking decisions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-dragon.png)&#34;&gt;a Dragon – the guardian of either the Ruler or the Treasure, and may symbolize the last, greatest obstacle in a quest;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-treasure.png)&#34;&gt;a Treasure – may symbolize that which you are seeking, whether riches, or knowledge, or peace, or anything else;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-soldier.png)&#34;&gt;a Soldier – may symbolize doing bad things on behalf of the Ruler, abandoning free will;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-builder.png)&#34;&gt;a Builder – may symbolize the power of creation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-seeker.png)&#34;&gt;a Seeker – may symbolize the will of pursuing a quest;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-lover.png)&#34;&gt;a Lover – may symbolize both desire and unity;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-servant.png)&#34;&gt;a Servant – may symbolize forced obedience;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-home.png)&#34;&gt;a Home – may symbolize your origin;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-mover.png)&#34;&gt;a Mover (blank) – may symbolize travel;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;yoric-figure&#34; style=&#34;list-style-image: url(/images/space-time-deck/bullet-fig-child.png)&#34;&gt;a Child (blank) – may symbolize innocence;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blanks are designed to be customized. Add your characters,
places or factions or cosmic powers of importance
in your campaign, or anything that you believe matters,
as and when you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a professionally printed copy of the
Space·Time Deck and plan to use the deck for several campaigns,
you probably want to use unstickable stickers/sticky notes
for customization. Or, simply, got to your local RPG shop
and buy card protectors for all your cards, to make sure
that they cannot be distinguished at first sight, then

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up on the diagram, it&amp;rsquo;s a stalemate)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;an Illustration;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Title;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an upright Interpretation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a reversed Interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suit cards also contain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Suit symbol;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The interpretation &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Nope, the sword is mightier&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; could mean that this is all some kind of bet. So, maybe the warrior is trying to kill all the dragons in the region, just to make some kind of point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The card is also a Dragon Figure, so it may also be considered some kind of guardian. For some reason, the warrior and his retinue are obstacles on the road towards the Temple. Perhaps they have blockaded a road or an area that the heroes need to cross to reach the Temple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here we go: in the course of the weeks that it takes them to travel to the Temple, the heroes find a trail of dead or dying dragon and dragon-like creatures, good and evil alike. They have all been hunted down by a young, irresponsible nobleman and his personal guard. This is the kind of action that will have bad, very bad consequences for the future of the entire kingdom. Also, in a more immediate matter, the personal guard of the nobleman is on the path of the heroes, and is going to prevent the heroes from progressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of bad consequences will the slaughter have? How are the personal guards going to cause problems for the heroes? Well, that sounds like questions for more cards!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Plotonomicon: About This Book</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/plotonomicon-about/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:22:48 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/plotonomicon-about/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As all good things do, this book starts with a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the story of a Game Master (let&amp;rsquo;s call her Alice), who spent weeks preparing a campaign for her players. Maybe the Players&amp;rsquo;s Characters were to be a company of heroes, who would save the land from a dragon. Or maybe they were students in magics, who were expected to find the sinister secrets of the Sorcerous Highschool. Or maybe they were survivors of a zombie apocalypse, who were to spend each of their days hiding from hordes of shambling undead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of questing for the Magical Dragonsword, the company of heroes actually made a treaty with the dragon, or organized a coup and had the king send all &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; men to look after the item. Instead of looking for the secret passage that would lead them to the Layer of the Monster Under the School, they decided to test the laws of magic, until they blew up the school, or they ran to the teacher, telling her all she needed to know to fix the problem without putting children in harm&amp;rsquo;s way. Instead of waiting for the zombies to come at them, they grabbed a ship, and started a new pirate republic of the seas, or perhaps they decided to go for Cape Kennedy and try to launch their own expedition to the distant Moon Colony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, Alice, I sympathize, we all do. All of us GMs have been here. And I also have good news for you: that&amp;rsquo;s where the story really starts. Because now you are going to be able to build something even better, without the fear of railroading your players and without the stress of expecting that everything has to be prepared perfectly. Just as importantly, this is an opportunity for everybody to build the campaign &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also the story of a Player (let&amp;rsquo;s call him Bob), who had no idea what kind of character he wanted to play. Alice had told him that this game was about vampires, or knights, or space smugglers, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t really think of any reason to pick a story rather than another one, or a specific class, or set of skills. So Bob didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a good time during character creation, and since his character didn&amp;rsquo;t have a reason to be, he didn&amp;rsquo;t have much fun around the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, Bob, nice to meet you. Yeah, getting in a setting is tricky and getting in a character is basically impossible if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you should be in that setting. So this book is for you, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo; also the story of a Writer, or a Storyteller (let&amp;rsquo;s call her Charlene), who had gotten her story started, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have fresh ideas for this antagonist, or that epic fight scene, or simply for finding out what laid behind the door that the hero had finally managed to open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Alice, hi Bob, hi Charlene. Welcome to &lt;em&gt;The Plotonomicon&lt;/em&gt;. In this book, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about getting ideas quickly and using them immediately, through techniques of improv. Some of these ideas will come from other players, others will come from the companion Space·Time Deck, and in many cases, you will realize that these are ideas that you already had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this book, we will describe situations that assume the existence of several players, each playing one character (or PC),
and one Game Master (or GM), playing the rest of the world, in particular the Non-Player Characters (or NPCs). Role-players will recognize the standard configuration of most Tabletop Role-Playing Games. However, this book is designed to be useful in more
situations than just standard Tabletop Role-Playing Games. If you are interested in other forms of storytelling, whether traditional (one storyteller in front of an audience), collaborative (several storytellers, weaving a story together, for each other or for an audience), or written (one writer or more, no audience), you should be able to adapt without difficulty most of the techniques described here to your favorite format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one last thing: if you are looking for a ruleset for role-playing games, you won&amp;rsquo;t find any in this book, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry: the sister book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;The N-Dimensional Tourists&lt;/a&gt; has you covered – it contains a dedicated ruleset for role-playing with only the Space·Time Deck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;this-content-is-deprecated&#34;&gt;THIS CONTENT IS DEPRECATED&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playtesting has indicated that these rules don&amp;rsquo;t work as well as hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll leave them here for historical reasons, but newer versions of &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists&lt;/a&gt; do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use these rules.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-back.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-back.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These rules describes how to resolve Conflicts between
two parties or more during a role-playing game using
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset&lt;/a&gt;.
This mechanism is designed to be generic enough to handle
pretty much any kind, while remaining mostly narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core idea behind this mechanism is that parties
involved battle for Control of the Conflict. Losing
Control means that your party will have to take more
risks to achieve the same results. With sufficient
Control, a party may essentially dictate the outcome
of the Conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-conflicts&#34;&gt;About Conflicts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Conflict&lt;/strong&gt; is a scene in which two parties or more have
agendas, which cannot be fulfilled simultaneously. In most role-playing
games, the most common form of conflict is the combat, but that is by
no mean the only form possible: conflict could be car races, social wit,
political campaigns, chess, battlefield strategy, attempting to ruin your
opponent&amp;rsquo;s reputation or fortune, popularity contests, football matches,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict does not have to be symmetrical. A guerilla may be attempting to
cause maximal damage to infrastructure while the government forces attempt
to destroy the guerilla forces. An outlying party may be attempting to
propagate its doctrine while the more traditional parties attempt to
maintain the status quo. A sniper may attempt to kill a target. A child
may be attempting to attract attention during a kidnapping attempt. A
mountain may be attempting to kill a climber while taking the risk of
losing the ability to surprise that climber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict does not have to be about killing or maiming. A chess game may
very well be a Conflict in which players are risking their reputation
and self-esteem. A soccer match between to groups of friends is a
Conflict in which both parties agree tacitly neither to take (too many)
risks, nor to make the other party take risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts assumes that both parties have some manner of assessing their
situation, and have some ability to act. In other words, as long as the
target of the sniper is not aware of the sniper, there is no conflict &lt;em&gt;between
the sniper and the target&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, if no other factors are in play,
the act of sniping will most likely be a simple case of &lt;strong&gt;Overcoming an obstacle&lt;/strong&gt;.
On the other hand, if the target is running away, there is a – very asummetrical —
conflict between the sniper and the target. Similarly, if an enemy patrol is
currently looking for an infiltrator, there is a conflict between the sniper&amp;rsquo;s
smarts, stealth and sniping ability and the enemy patrol&amp;rsquo;s smarts and detection
ability. Similarly, if the traditional parties are busy quelling a political
crisis or are unaware of the outlying party, there is no conflict between the
outlying party and the traditional parties – although there could be a
conflict between the outlying party and a specific candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts decide whether any of the parties manage to reach their desired
outcome. In the case of a race, the desired outcome is typically arriving
first. In the case of a gang fight, the desired outcome is typically getting
the other gang to end up broken and bleeding or fleeing. In the case of a
sniper vs. patrol, the desired outcome is typically evading the patrol and
killing the target vs. capturing the intruder before he has the chance to
cause damage. The players representing each party must have a clear idea
of the desired outcome for the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/illustrations/Combat Knights 6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Credits: Flickr user Paul K&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are, of course, entirely free to change the desired outcome, but this
may end up completely changing the state of the conflict. For instance, if
the hidden sniper finds themself cornered, they may decide to change plan,
create maximum chaos and attempt to escape – but that&amp;rsquo;s a new conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;required-material&#34;&gt;Required material&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict resolution needs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Space·Time Deck;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few tokens per party (a total of 10 tokens or 1d10 should be amply sufficient);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of space on the table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will need to organize your cards into several heaps, we suggest using
the following Playing Mat. Experience shows that it is very helpful
for your first few attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, it recapitulates the Conflict resolution rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/plotonomicon/playingmat.png&#34; alt=&#34;The N-Dimensional Tourist Playing Mat&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to print one for each player!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;setting-up-the-conflict&#34;&gt;Setting up the Conflict&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a Conflict, each party attempts to reach a goal, by adopting shifting
tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key concept during a Conflict is the Control, which represents how close the
Dominant party is to having complete control of the Conflict. If the Conflict is
balanced, there is no Dominant party and the Control is 0. Otherwise, there
is a Dominant party, and its Control value is a positive number. Regardless of
how many parties are involved in the Conflict, only one party may have the Control.
Once a party has complete control of the Conflict, none can stop it from reaching
its goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Conflict takes place as a sequence of Rounds. Each Round represents all parties
attempting to execute their tactics to either grab the Control, if the Conflict
is Balanced, or otherwise strengthen/weaken the Control. Two successive Rounds may
represent entirely different durations, depending on what makes sense in the story –
one round may very well last ten minutes and the next one ten years, without problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To grab the Control, strengthen their Control or weaken the opponent&amp;rsquo;s Control,
each party may need to take risks. With risks come the possibility of Losses. Depending
on the Conflict, Losses may represent wounds, engine issues, delays, lack of information,
loss of soldiers, etc. As a
party accumulates Losses, it becomes weaker, hence making it easier for other parties
to beat them. Losses may end up with a party being Wiped Out. That&amp;rsquo;s not something
you want to see happen to your party, as this represents the worst possible outcome –
possibly death, or slavery, or social infamy, or life behind bars, depending on the
Conflict. Rather, most parties leave a Conflict by Conceding it, which may represent
for instance the party surrendering, fleeing, stepping down from power, etc. depending
on the Conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking risks is represented by a bidding mechanism – each card drawn increases the party&amp;rsquo;s
chance of achieving their tactics for the round, but also the chance of being hit by
Losses. Higher Control gives the Dominant party the ability to draw more cards before
they start taking risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, during the Conflict, a party finds itself in a situation in which it can suddenly
gain an advantage for reasons related to the story, rather than the cards themselves,
this party may take the opportunity, hence causing the Conflict to end immediately
and resume on different terms. This is called Reframing the Conflict. This is what
happens if a discussion leads to violence, or if a fleeing driver leaves the vehicle
to enter the subway, or if a political figure caught in a scandal declares a War
on Terror to distract the public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s now see the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;establishing-parties-and-goals&#34;&gt;Establishing parties and goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do during a Conflict is to establish the parties and the goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, parties and goals are only acceptable if they make sense within the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a Kaiju setting. This is Wednesday morning, so a giant monster is attacking Tokyo.
For some reason, everybody knows its name: Levinulon. The Mechanized Tokyo Defense Force is currently mobilizing. Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s Police is attempting to shoot at Levinulon using whatever is
at hand, but they have no chance of doing any damage. Civilians are fleeing. A gang of
criminals (&amp;ldquo;Family Z&amp;rdquo;) is taking advantage of the chaos to rob a bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the sides? Well, it depends on who is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/posts/tourists-conflict-resolution/kaiju.png&#34; alt=&#34;Picture by Wikipedia User D J Shin – My Toy Museum – Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are interested in Levinulon and the Mechanized Tokyo Defense Force, then these are the two sides. Levinulon intends to destroy the city, while the Mechanized Tokyo Defense Force intends to
save the city. The Police and civilians will certainly take damange, as well as Tokyo itself, but they have no means of altering the outcome of the Conflict. Rather, they will be used for narrative purposes, to show the progress of Levinulon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, maybe we are concentrating on the Conflict between Family Z and Police. Family Z intends
to grab the contents of the bank vaults and leave during the chaos, while the Police intends
arrest or shoot the gangsters. In this case,
the Mechanized Tokyo Defense Force, Levinulon and the Civilizans will be there only for
narrative purposes, for instance to explain why the Police may end up losing Control
against such a low-profile gang (&amp;ldquo;all our communication channels are busy, we can&amp;rsquo;t
synchronize&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe we are concentrating on the efforts of Police officers to evacuate civilians towards safety bunkers. In this case, the parties are the Police officers and Generalized destruction.
Police officers intend to avoid Civilian losses, while Generalized destruction intends to
maximize it – of course, this only makes sense if Generalized destruction can somehow be interpreted as having a goal and tactics. This depends entirely on the kind of story you intend to tell. Here, the Mechanized Tokyo Defense Force, Levinulon, the Civilians and Family Z are there purely for narrative purposes, and will serve to explain increasing or decreasing Control by
Police officers and Generalized destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that none of these examples &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be a Conflict. The Mechanized Tokyo Defense Force
vs. Levinulon, or Family Z vs. the Police, or the Police vs. Civilian losses may very well
be represented as &lt;strong&gt;Overcoming Obstacles&lt;/strong&gt; if one of the sides is considered a simple obstacle
rather than an active Conflict Party. The GM gets to decide what feels more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-here-comes-a-new-challenger&#34;&gt;Example: Here comes a new challenger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the US Covert Mech Operations are in Tokyo for an unrelated reason. They are going to join the Conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this make it a three-sided Conflict? Well, it depends on what the US Covert Mech Operations intend to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the US Covert Mech Operations join forces with the Mechanized Tokyo Defense Force, then no. They are going to help with the initial Control, and they are going to have a narrative role, but for the purpose of rules, they are part of the same party as the Mechanized Tokyo Defense Force. So, this remains a Conflict between two sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is possible that the US Covert Mech Operations was in Tokyo for economic warfare purposes, and the Mechanized Tokyo Defense Force has strict orders to disable their mechs and help the Police capture the US Covert Mech Operations agents, in addition to fighting Levinulon. The US Covert Mech Operations need to reach the Tokyo Stock Exchange and hack it before Levinulon destroys it, shooting down any Mechanized Tokyo Defense Force Officer that comes in the way. Meanwhile, Levinulon is quite happy to destroy everything. In this case, we have three sides in the Conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, it looks like a helicopter crew of All Nippon News Network has just arrived on the site. The objective of this helicopter crew is, of course, to gather the best possible images, which may mean putting itself in danger. A vicious GM may decide to make this helicopter crew yet another party. One of the objectives of the Mechanized Tokyo Defense Force is to defend the All Nippon News Network Crew, which means preventing it from getting the best images. The US Covert Mech Operations must not leave any recorded trace, which also means destroying the helicopter crew. If so, the site has just become a four-sided Conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;establishing-control&#34;&gt;Establishing Control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each party gets to pick the Attribute they use for the Conflict, as long as it makes sense within the story. Driving Mechs to battle requires either Blades (for the violence), Serpent (for the quick reflexes) or Paper (for the strategy) – of course, you may only do so if you have an Aspect that implies that you can drive Mechs at all. Destroying Tokyo with sheer force requires either Blades (for the violence) or Stone (for the raw power). Leading Civilians to safety requires either Paper (for the strategy) or Stone (for the authority).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the numerical value of the Attribute of the party as a baseline. For each Aspect that the party has that makes sense within the Conflict, add 1. Similarly, for each Weakness that makes sense, remove 1. If the party doesn&amp;rsquo;t have its own Attributes but is composed of several characters, take as baseline the best Attribute across characters, and all the Aspects and Weaknesses that make sense, for all characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating NPCs or parties, it is common to write directly a specialized Attribute that may be used during such conflicts, e.g. Levinulon may have Destroy Everything at 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party with highest total starts with the Control. The value of the advantage is the number of ranks of difference between the highest total and the second-highest. Note that if this rank is 5 or more, the chances of the leading party winning are extremely strong, so it may not be necessary to actually have a Conflict. If no party has the highest total, the Conflict starts Balanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Conflict with three parties or more, this may mean that a party that is comparatively much weaker than the others starts Balanced. This represents the fact that both stronger parties will be much busier fighting each other than fighting this smaller party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one of the Parties has a Control of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; ranks, put as many tokens in front of the corresponding player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-1&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us concentrate on the main event: the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force vs. Levinulon. As mentioned above, Levinulon has been defined with a specialized attribute Destroy Everything at 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force as a whole is defined with a Paper of 5, thanks to the excellent command team. On its character sheet, it also a &lt;em&gt;Well-trained team&lt;/em&gt; (+1), &lt;em&gt;The most agile mechs in the world&lt;/em&gt; (+1) and &lt;em&gt;Excellent knowledge of Tokyo&lt;/em&gt; (+1). Sadly, during the latest fight, it was determined that &lt;em&gt;The second-in-command is severely wounded&lt;/em&gt; – and is probably still in the hospital – (-1). The total is 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 8 - 7, Levinulon has a slight Control (1). The GM gets one token to materialize this Control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-here-comes-a-new-challenger-1&#34;&gt;Example: Here comes a new challenger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/posts/tourists-conflict-resolution/mech.png&#34; alt=&#34;Picture by Flickr User Brian Rinker – Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Generic 2.0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s add the US Covert Mech Operations to the mix. It is a team of &lt;em&gt;Highly-trained Operatives&lt;/em&gt; (+1), with a Blades of 5. It also has &lt;em&gt;Deadly tactical weapons&lt;/em&gt; (+1), &lt;em&gt;Space-to-Ground support&lt;/em&gt; (+1), &lt;em&gt;Regenerative Alloy&lt;/em&gt; (+1). It has been established as Weakness that they also have &lt;em&gt;Limited Knowledge of Tokyo&lt;/em&gt; (-1). This gives them a total of 8, at equality with Levinulon. Consequently, in a three-sided Conflict, the Conflict starts Balanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody receives any token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This remains true if we add the All Nippon News Network Crew, with a Serpent of 4 and &lt;em&gt;No Fear&lt;/em&gt; (+1) for a total of 5. Despite the fact that the Crew is so puny with respect of all the other parties, the rules don&amp;rsquo;t give it a specific disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that, despite the Balanced start, the All Nippon News Network Crew has no ability to actually attack Levinulon. Therefore, its goal simply cannot be to somehow beat Levinulon. Also, if the goal was to beat Levinulon, the All Nippon News Network Crew would have been considered part of the
same party as the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparing-reserve-for-npcs&#34;&gt;Preparing Reserve for NPCs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All player-controlled characters and parties have a Reserve of Cards, which they use to counter bad luck or make their own luck. That&amp;rsquo;s because they are, after all, main characters/parties. Antagonists typically also have a Reserve of Cards. Most antagonists are only expected to appear in a short part of the story, so they only get a smaller Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many Reserve Cards a non-player party gets is decided by the GM. A typical number is one Card per opposing faction that has a Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a non-player party gets Reserve Cards, draw them before the Conflict and put them on the party&amp;rsquo;s character sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-2&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has been defined, as a whole, with a single character sheet. It therefore has one Reserve, which may contain cards or be empty. Therefore, Levinulon draws one card and puts it in its Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force had been created as a set of 5 different characters with individual sheets, each characters would have one Reserve. Therefore, Levinulon would draw 5 cards into its Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-here-comes-a-new-challenger-2&#34;&gt;Example: Here comes a new challenger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to assume that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has a single character sheet and Reserve;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the US Covert Mech Operations has a single character sheet and Reserve;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the All Nippon News Network Crew has a single character sheet and Reserve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Levinulon draws 3 cards in its Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;resolving-the-conflict&#34;&gt;Resolving the Conflict&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conflict is composed of rounds. During each round, each party has a tactics to either
grab the advantage (if the Conflict is Balanced), consolidate their advantage (if they
are the Dominant party) or weaken the advantage of the Dominant party (otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each round is composed of a succession of bids. Each bid is an opportunity for a party to
take more risks in the pursuit of their immediate tactics. Once bids are complete, parties
get to narrate what happened to their character during the round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;declaring-tactics&#34;&gt;Declaring tactics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before drawing cards, each party must describe their tactics for the round. Tactics may
change from round to round, and should always be a manner of achieving either control
of the Conflict or reaching the stated Goal of the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactics live purely in the fiction, rather than the rules – in other words, they have no
impact on the drawing of cards. However, they open the way to Reframing the Conflict
(see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/posts/tourists-conflict-resolution/Napoleon.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ludwig Elsholtz Napoleon I. mit seinen Generalen – Public Domain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, tactics are only acceptable if they make sense within the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-3&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this two-sided Conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon: &amp;ldquo;I will simply attempt to do as much damage as I can, trampling the subway if it&amp;rsquo;s close to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;We move to intercept Levinulon and distract it from the crowds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-here-comes-a-new-challenger-3&#34;&gt;Example: Here comes a new challenger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this four-sided Conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon: &amp;ldquo;I will simply attempt to do as much damage as I can, trampling the subway if it&amp;rsquo;s close to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;For the moment, we&amp;rsquo;re spreading around the area, attempting to find the best angle of attack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Covert Mech Operations: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re pushing to maximum speed, trying to find a path to the Tokyo Stock Exchange before we can be seen on camera and before anybody or anything blocks our way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Nippon News Network Crew: &amp;ldquo;For the moment, we&amp;rsquo;re being cautious, we&amp;rsquo;re moving on top of a building, getting ready to jump into the action.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;balance-breaker-rounds&#34;&gt;Balance Breaker Rounds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balance Breaker Rounds happen whenever no party has managed to grab the Control. Balance Breaker Rounds can cause minor Losses, but nothing more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a balanced round, bidding proceeds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each parties draws one card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If one of the parties has drawn the Excuse:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bidding is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proceed to the end of the Round. The next round will be another Balance Breaker Round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, if one of the card has drawn a card that beats all other cards

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This party now has a Control of 1. Give that party one token to represent this Control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bidding is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proceed to the end of the round. The next round will be Unbalanced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bidding is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proceed to the end of the Round. The next round will be another Balance Breaker Round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This flow may be altered by taking advantage of Losses (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; discard the cards immediately. Reversed cards will be reused at the end of the Round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-here-comes-a-new-challenger-4&#34;&gt;Example: Here comes a new challenger&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-21.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-21.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we see, the All Nippon News Network Crew has drawn the XVI of Triumph, which beats
all non-Triumph cards (in this case, the US Covert Mech Operations) and all Triumph
cards with lower numbers (Levinulon and Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The All Nippon News Network Crew has gained an Initiative of 1. The next round will therefore be an Unbalanced Round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three reversed cards will be collected and reused as temporary Losses below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unbalanced-round&#34;&gt;Unbalanced Round&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a round starts Unbalanced in favor of a party (the Dominant), the objective of the Dominant
is to both use their power to drive the other parties (the Contenders) out of the game and to consolidate their advantage. Conversely, the objective of the other parties (the Contenders) is to stay in the game and decrease the advantage of the Dominant, hopefully returning it to Balance. To do this, the Dominant and the Contenders take part in a succession of &lt;em&gt;bids&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of an Unbalanced Round, if the Dominant has an advantage of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, the player must have &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; token in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bidding is the act of deciding to draw one card, then placing it in front of the player without changing its orientation. Drawing a card increases both the risk to the party and its ability to grab or consolidate advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contender parties speak first, in an arbitrary order (clockwise around the table works nicely),
each bidding or passing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dominant may then bid or pass;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repeats until one of the conditions below is encountered:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a party has just drawn the Excuse:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Control of the Dominant is decreased by 1, possibly returning the Conflict to Balanced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The player who drew the Excuse discards it, regardless of orientation, and draws another card for narrative purpose. If this card is reversed, it will be reused at the end of the Round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proceed to the end of the Round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, if the party has drawn 5 reversed cards during this round:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The party is Wiped Out and is now out of the Conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If at least one party is still part of the Conflict and has not passed

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue bidding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proceed to the end of the Round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, if all parties that are still in the Conflict have just passed

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If at least one Contender (including a Contender that has just been Wiped Out) has a set of cards that beats all the cards of the Dominant (each card of the Dominant needs to be beaten only by one card of the Contender)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Control of the Dominant is decreased by 1, possibly returning the Conflict to Balanced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Control of the Dominant is increased by 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In either case, Proceed to the end of the Round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-4.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that no stalemate is possible in an Unbalanced Round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flow may be altered by using the Control, or Using the other party&amp;rsquo;s Losses (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-4&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have previously established that, in a two-sided Conflict, Levinulon has a Control of 1. So the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws 
&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon draws 
&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-66.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;/images/space-time-deck/card-66.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force is currently losing, with its Paper beaten by the Blades. Consequently, it draws 
&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-79.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon is still winning as its Blades beat both the Paper and the Serpent, so it passes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws 
&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-19.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon is now beaten by the Triumph, so it draws 
&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-9.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 At this stage, Levinulon could incur a Temporary Loss (see below). However, using its Control Token (see below), it turns the card around, into 
&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force is currently winning, with the highest Triumph, so it passes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon draws: 
&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 It now has experiences at least a Temporary Loss (see below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force is still winning, with the highest Triumph, so it passes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon draws:

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 At this stage, Levinulon has at least a Lasting Loss (see below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force&amp;rsquo;s Triumph is now beaten by a higher Triumph. Reasoning that it has only about 10% chances of finding a Triumph higher than XVI. in the remaining cards, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force passes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon still passes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bidding is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levinulon has increased its Control, but at the cost of a Lasting Loss (see below), while the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has escaped without Loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has the lead and passes. If the All Nippon News Network Crew does not manage to beat this card, it will lose the Control in the next round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US Covert Mech Operations team is content to let the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force take care of removing the All Nippon News Network Crew&amp;rsquo;s Control, and passes.&lt;/li&gt;

 If The All Nippon News Network Crew draws a third reversed card, it will suffer a Lasting Loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force still has the lead and passes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US Covert Mech Operations still passes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon similarly passes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasoning that drawing another card would mean about 50% chances of a Lasting Loss and roughly 10% chances of beating the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force&amp;rsquo;s Triumph, the All Nippon News Network Crew stops taking risks for this round and passes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bidding is over. The All Nippon News Network has lost its Control of 1, meaning that the Conflict will now need a Balance Breaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ending-the-round&#34;&gt;Ending the Round&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Rounds end the same way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Losses are counted;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;outcomes are narrated;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a party may be victorious;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parties have an opportunity to either Concede the Conflict or reframe it;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cards that do not serve to mark Losses are shuffled back into the deck;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Reserve may be refilled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;determining-losses&#34;&gt;Determining Losses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts are risky. This is represented by reversed cards that accumulate,
resulting in Temporary Losses, Lasting Losses of increasing gravity, or
even Wipe Outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, during the Round, a party has drawn&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 reversed cards

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they have experienced no Loss;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 or 2 reversed card

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they have experienced a Temporary Loss;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put either one of the cards on the table, on a line of cards reserved for Temporary Losses;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the party must narrate the Loss;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this Loss is Temporary – it will disappear as soon as it has been used by an adversary, or at the end of the Conflict;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 or 4 reserved cards

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they have experienced a Lasting Loss;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put 3 of the cards on the table, on a second line of cards, reserved for Lasting Losses;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the party must narrate the Loss;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this Loss will carry over after the end of the Conflict, until it has somehow been cured;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;narratively,

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first Loss of a party during a Conflict is something that will be very easy to cure/heal/fix – a little rest, maybe some first aid, etc. will do wonders;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the second Loss of a party during a Conflict is something that should be relatively easy to cure/heal/fix – the kind of Loss that can happen automatically between two scenarios, or by seeing a professional;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the third Loss of a party during a Conflict is something that should be difficult to cure/heal/fix – a scenario might be necessary to find a cure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fourth Loss of a party during a Conflict is something very hard to cure/heal/fix – an entire campaign might be necessary to find a cure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;further Losses are permanent – they may never be cured, short of a miracle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few points to remember:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For narration purposes, use at least one of the cards that make this Loss. While this is not always possible, ideally, you should be able to weave a narrative that uses all the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While you may narrate things that have happened to you because of other parties&amp;rsquo; actions, each player has sole narrative control upon their party. In other word, other players may overrule any description you make of their actions and successes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are the sole owner of your character&amp;rsquo;s narration, hence the only person who can describe your Losses. You get to determine whether a Loss is physical, psychological, emotional, material, etc. Just keep in mind the gravity of the Loss, as seen above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s three reversed cards, so Levinulon experiences its first Lasting Loss:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon: &amp;ldquo;While stomping around Tokyo and causing general havoc, I knock out a major electricity relay and somehow electrocute myself. In a matter of seconds, the relay goes down, leaving me barely phased.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This establishes the Fact that Levinulon is (at least somewhat) vulnerable to electricity. All players will be able to weave this Fact in their narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s first Lasting Loss of the conflict, it will be able to recover with only a little rest. However, a second Lasting Loss will be more consequent. There&amp;rsquo;s still hope for Tokyo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They all experience Temporary Losses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon: &amp;ldquo;In an attempt to go too fast, I stepped on a bridge, causing it to collapse with me on top of it. I&amp;rsquo;m so large that it&amp;rsquo;s not a problem, but it will take me a few seconds to get back on course.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;It took a few minutes for the communication center to reach Hazuki, so we arrived a bit late.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Covert Mech Operations: &amp;ldquo;With the number of cameras and armed forces on scene, we risk an international incident, so our mobility is limited for the moment. Also, since Levinulon drew a card which clearly represents the Stock Exchange, if it&amp;rsquo;s ok, I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume that Levinulon is on our way and pretty close to the Stock Exchange, which makes things harder for us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They each suffer one Temporary Loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Covert Mech Operations: &amp;ldquo;The police network channel that we were hacking to get traffic information has been disrupted by the destruction. We&amp;rsquo;ll have a few difficulties mapping our route.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Nippon News Network Crew discards one of the cards, decides to interpret the Snakes card as a labyrinth: &amp;ldquo;Our pilot picked an approach route that keeps us out of the line of fire, but he needs to fly between buildings, which takes all his concentration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;narrating-outcomes&#34;&gt;Narrating outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the Round, each party has narrated the tactics that they were going to employ during the Round. They now get to narrate what has happened, exactly, starting with whoever won the Round (if there is a winner), then whoever lost it (if there is a loser), then everybody else (if there is an everybody else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few points to remember:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For narration purposes, use at least one of the cards that you have drawn during this Round. While this is not always possible, ideally, you should be able to weave a narrative that uses all the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While you may narrate things that have happened to other parties because of or in reaction to your party&amp;rsquo;s tactics, each player has sole narrative control upon their party. In other word, other players may overrule any description you make of their actions and successes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether your actions succeeded or failed is entirely up to you to decide. What the cards have determined is how the Control has progressed, but even whether you gained/lost, strengthened/weakened your advantage, you may well decide that all your individual actions have failed, or that they have succeeded, or that they have had unexpected results, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;example-kaiju-6&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall, the tactics were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon: &amp;ldquo;I will simply attempt to do as much damage as I can, trampling the subway if it’s close to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;We move to intercept Levinulon and distract it from the crowds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its Lasting Loss, Levinulon has increased its Control, with a few cards including

            alt=&#34;Card number 76&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This not only suggests that the tactics have succeeded, but also that Levinulon has managed to destroy quite a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon: &amp;ldquo;For the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying myself in this sandbox. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has managed to grab my attention yet, and the electrical shock I have just sustained doesn&amp;rsquo;t manage to bring down my enthusiasm, so I&amp;rsquo;m happily stomping around, &lt;em&gt;Leaping like a Giant&lt;/em&gt;, leaving behind me &lt;em&gt;A very, very obvious trail&lt;/em&gt;, playing &lt;em&gt;Absolute Power&lt;/em&gt;. I assume that, in the imagination of the citizens, my &lt;em&gt;Rising to Power&lt;/em&gt; to become a very, very credible threat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the player behind Levinulon could have decided an entirely different story, for instance fighting the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force drew

        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Obviously, we failed to intercept Levinulon. That&amp;rsquo;s because of Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s accident with the power relay – we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get too close, either, to avoid damaging our Mechs. However, thanks to this incident, we believe that we have &lt;em&gt;Uncovered&lt;/em&gt; a weakness of Levinulon. We&amp;rsquo;re reporting this to the headquarters so that they can try and &lt;em&gt;Create&lt;/em&gt; a strategy or some gadgets to help us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, these elements may be used in the rest of the Conflict: the weakness of Mechs to electricity, the constant communication with headquarters, the headquarters looking for a manner to use electricity against Levinulon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the 4-sided Balance Breaker, the parties had established the following tactics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon: &amp;ldquo;I will simply attempt to do as much damage as I can, trampling the subway if it&amp;rsquo;s close to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;For the moment, we&amp;rsquo;re spreading around the area, attempting to find the best angle of attack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Covert Mech Operations: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re pushing to maximum speed, trying to find a path to the Tokyo Stock Exchange before we can be seen on camera and before anybody or anything blocks our way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Nippon News Network Crew: &amp;ldquo;For the moment, we&amp;rsquo;re being cautious, we&amp;rsquo;re moving on top of a building, getting ready to jump into the action.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Nippon News Network Crew then won the Round with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All Nippon News Network Crew: &amp;ldquo;We found a great angle with visibility on all the rampage. I don&amp;rsquo;t think we have noticed the US Covert Mech Operations yet, but we have a great footage to capture the &lt;em&gt;imagination&lt;/em&gt; of spectators. I think that we&amp;rsquo;re the only helicopter with such great footage, so we&amp;rsquo;re going to have great ratings!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Let me confess something: at the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force, we don&amp;rsquo;t really like the press. Like the Police, we have to play nice with them, and show them a smiling face and cooperate, but we secretely hate these people. We have to get them out of danger right now, and if this means showing them a face that they won&amp;rsquo;t like either, that&amp;rsquo;s ok. So our commander takes the microphone and starts yelling something along the lines of &amp;lsquo;You, in the helicopter, you are in a restricted area. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t left the danger zone within five seconds, we&amp;rsquo;re going to open fire, and if you happen to be in our reticles, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up shot. This is your only warning!&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All Nippon News Network Crew: &amp;ldquo;Oh, gosh. We&amp;rsquo;re going to take this warning seriously and exercise &lt;em&gt;Caution&lt;/em&gt;. But, well, we&amp;rsquo;re the All Nippon News Network Crew, we &lt;em&gt;Make the Future Happen&lt;/em&gt; on TV or online, so we&amp;rsquo;re not giving up. Actually, that&amp;rsquo;s probably the reason for which we had to go in this labyrinth between buildings. So, we left the immediate fire zone, turned around the conflict, and we&amp;rsquo;re now hidden between these buildings, where we hope that nobody can see us, or at least shoot us down. It might also be a good angle to notice the US Covert Mech Operations, by the way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Covert Mech Operations: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re still heading towards the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It&amp;rsquo;s tricky because of the chaos, and we have lost our traffic data, plus we still need to be discreet, but we&amp;rsquo;ll get there, eventually.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conceding-a-conflict&#34;&gt;Conceding a Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being Wiped Out is not something to be taken lightly. The victor of the Conflict has complete narrative control of the situation and may decide whatever makes sense within the story – this may include killing all the party members, shaming them in front of their pears, leaving them no choice but exile, or dragging them to a convent to spend the rest of their lives in isolation, or driving them to bankrupcy&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the issue is not necessarily strictly fatal, it is clearly Very Bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; how most Confrontations end. Rather, most parties will decide to Concede a Conflict rather than Wiped Out. Conceding is something that may happen at any end of round, provided that the party hasn&amp;rsquo;t been Wiped Out yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceding the Conflict still means that the party has lost and that their objective now cannot be achieved anymore. It is costly. However, the players keep narrative control over their characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, in the interest of helping the story bounce back, Conceding a Conflict restores the Cards Reserve of the party that has just Conceded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; possible to return to the Conflict after having Conceded it. If this was your intention, take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;#reframing-a-conflict&#34;&gt;Reframing the Conflict&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;example-kaiju-later-round-wipe-out&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju, later round (Wipe Out)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s fast-forward our two-sided Conflict, to a point where the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has suffered five consecutive reversed cards. The force is out of Reserve cards and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any Control point, so there is no way to cancel this fifth reversed card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has just been Wiped Out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player behind Levinulon (in this case, the GM), has full control over what happens to the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force. This player may, for instance, decide that all team members are dead – and how they died. Incidentally, Levinulon has won and will destroy most of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GM decides to keep the party alive, barely. Levinulon has no special interest in destroying the force itself, just the city. So, the mechs are destroyed, the headquarters of the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force have been trampled and destroyed in the process, killing most of the supporting NPCs and all of the infrastructure. That&amp;rsquo;s not all, as Levinulon also crushed the bunker hosting the Japanese Prime Minister, causing an unprecedented political crisis in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mech pilots somehow manage to get out of their mechs and to make their way towards an hospital outside of Tokyo. After a few days of watching the catastrophe on all TV channels and websites, they are all deeply depressed, some of them suicidal. To make things worse, the army dispatches the military police to round up the pilots and arrest them, on trumped up charges of treason, in the false hope that scapegoats and a hope of revenge will help the army keep some discipline in the country. Their story will continue with them in prison, waiting for word of their execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, being Wiped Out is that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s now fast-forward our four-sided Conflict, to a point where the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has suffered three Lasting Losses, two of them due to a firefight between itself and the US Covert Mech Operations team. Most of the Japanese Mechs are destroyed,
Levinulon is happily rampaging – and has the Control – and given their current condition, there isn&amp;rsquo;t anything that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player beyind Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force decides to Concede. The combat is lost for the team, but as this is a Concession, the player can determine the terms of this loss, as long as it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll somehow get in touch with the commander of the US Covert Mech Operations team. If necessary, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the loudspeakers. &amp;lsquo;Commander, I don&amp;rsquo;t know who you are, but I will call upon your honor. Me and my team are severely wounded, we need to withdraw immediately. Please, commander, whatever your mission is, you have won. I now beg you to spare my soldiers. And if you find it in yourself to concentrate your fire on the best that is now murdering the innocent citizens of Tokyo, please, please, do so.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these terms require collaboration from the US Covert Mech Operations, the player may decide to reject them, in which case the
Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force player will need to come up with an alternative explanation of why the US Covert Mech Operations doesn&amp;rsquo;t manage to tear them to pieces. For instance, it is possible that a skyscraper suddenly falls on both teams, forcing them apart, and that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force takes the opportunity to call for retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the player behind the US Covert Mech Operations decides to accept the conditions of the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force. The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force may limp away from the fight, hoping to eventually recover from their losses. Since there have been three Lasting Losses, getting back up to strength will require a campaign-long quest, attempting to gather political support, the technological knowledge and the rare material needed to build new and upgraded mechs, despite the loss of face just incurred, and possibly recruiting new team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Conflict continues with only three sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having surviving mechs, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force may not return to the Conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;determining-victory&#34;&gt;Determining victory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only one party remains, all the other ones either have been Wiped Out or having Conceded, the last party standing is the victor, and achieves their objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the Conflict continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reframing-a-conflict&#34;&gt;Reframing a Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many stories, a Conflict will end before being resolved, simply because the characters have changed their objectives, or their means. Perhaps a fisticuff has become a battle of wits or magic, or perhaps a poker game has ended with a character drawing their gun. Perhaps a chess player has decided to drug their opponent&amp;rsquo;s drink, threaten their family and invite pole dancers to provide a distraction and prevent them from thinking properly. Perhaps a time-traveller or a multiverse tourist has decided to abandon mundane manners to resolve a quarrel, and have decided to bring in a few dinosaurs to the car race. Perhaps two of the three cow-boys locked in a Mexican Stand-off have decided to join forces and finish their common enemy, at least until the unavoidable betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps a party has found a last-minute idea to avoid being Wiped Out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of rules, all of these complete changes to the layout of the Conflict are called Reframing. Note that simply using a different tactics to achieve the same goals does not, by itself, Reframe a Conflict – that&amp;rsquo;s simply what happens naturally at every round. A Reframed Conflict must have &lt;em&gt;different goals&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;different means&lt;/em&gt;. The GM is in charge of validating whether a change in a Conflict is simply a new tactics or a full Reframing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a Conflict is Reframed, the Conflict stops immediately. Parties, goals and Control are re-established. Generally, this means that a party that had a high Control must restart with a lower Control, or possibly without any Control. If you have experienced Temporary Losses, they are discarded. If you have experienced Lasting Losses, copy them to your character sheet as Weaknesses, but discard the cards. Your next Lasting Loss will be, once again, something simple to heal/fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all of this is done, re-establish the Control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;example-here-comes-a-new-challenger-later-round-1&#34;&gt;Example: Here comes a new challenger, later round&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has limped away from the fight, there are only three sides left, with the following objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levinulon: Destroy Tokyo, including the Tokyo Stock Exchange, destroying anything that annoys it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US Covert Mech Operations: Infiltrate the Tokyo Stock Exchange, killing anything in their way, including witnesses, and outmanoeuvering Levinulon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Nippon News Network: Film everything, even if it means putting other parties in jeopardy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if the following changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps the All Nippon News Network crew may change their objectives and decide to try and lead Levinulon away from the city. In this case, the US Covert Mech Operations will be able to get into the Tokyo Stock Exchange without trouble, hence removing them from the Conflict. This changes the parties in presence and the objectives, which means that the Conflict is Reframed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps the US Covert Mech Operations may decide to change weapons and use orbital fire support to attack Levinulon? That&amp;rsquo;s not a change in objectives, just one in tactics, so the Conflict proceeds as previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if the US Covert Mech Operations decided that the only way to maintain anonymity was to abandon the mission and somehow call for gravity harpoons be dropped on Tokyo in the interest of fighting the monster? That is a drastic change in situation – rather than fighting its way towards the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the US Covert Mech Operations team now needs to leave Tokyo before the carpet bombing. This would also Reframe the Conflict – or perhaps change it into something altogether different from a Conflict, such as a race against the clock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if the US Covert Mech Operations and Levinulon somehow managed to communicate and reached an agreement? They would stop fighting each other, letting the US Covert Mech Operations reach its objectives and concentrate fire on witnesses and obstacles. This would also Reframe the Conflict – or, once again, perhaps change it into something altogether different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if the US Covert Mech Operations and the All Nippon News Network somehow managed to join forces in an effort to destroy Levinulon? They would both abandon their objectives, Reframing the Conflict into a combined trap against the monster. Until, of course, the unavoidable betrayal by one side or the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;changing-the-flow-of-the-round&#34;&gt;Changing the flow of the Round&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three ways to change the flow of a Round:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using the Control to minimize one&amp;rsquo;s Losses and/or maximize another party&amp;rsquo;s Losses;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using another party&amp;rsquo;s Losses to prevent them from achieving their tactics;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using Reserve cards to do either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three ways work both during a Balance Breaker or an Unbalanced Round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-control&#34;&gt;Using the Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the Control means that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to take as many risks to achieve your goals. This is materialized by the ability for the party with the Control to &lt;em&gt;turn cards&lt;/em&gt; – to either reverse them (hence causing or increasing Losses for other parties) or un-reverse them (to avoid Losses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a Control of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; ranks, you may (un)reversing &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; cards during a Round. To remember this limit, if you have an  Control of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, you start the round with &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; Control Tokens (or, equivalently, one d10 set to &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;). Each time you turn one card, this costs you 1 Control Token. All Control Tokens not expended by the end of the round are lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, having many Control Tokens is a considerable boon. Recall that, if an adversary party has 5 cards in front of them and you can afford to spend 5 Control Tokens, you can simply decide that this party has been Wiped Out during the round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may only turn a card immediately after that card is drawn and placed on the table. Control does not work against Reserve Cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;example-here-comes-a-new-challenger-balance-breaker&#34;&gt;Example: Here comes a new challenger, Balance Breaker&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the four-sided conflict above, the All Nippon News Network Crew had drawn its first card reversed. Rather than facing an immediate Temporary Loss, it decided to use its sole Control Token to un-reverse the card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next round, there is no Control, so nobody will be able to turn a card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;example-kaiju-7&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two-sided conflict above, Levinulon has used its sole Control Token to un-reverse its first reversed card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next Round, Levinulon has two Control tokens, so it will be able to do this operation twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-losses&#34;&gt;Using Losses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Losses make your party weaker. This is materialized by the ability for adversary parties to reject cards drawn by your party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever your party experiences Losses, whether Temporary or Lasting, these Losses are represented by cards, &lt;em&gt;face visible&lt;/em&gt;, on your side of the table. A Temporary Loss is represented by 1 card, a Lasting Loss by 3 cards. As long as you have such cards, &lt;em&gt;face visible&lt;/em&gt;, when it is your turn to draw a card that another party doesn&amp;rsquo;t like, that other party may ask you to simply discard the card you have just placed. Since a Loss has been used against you, you get to turn one of the Loss cards in front of you face down, which means that it won&amp;rsquo;t be used against you again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, having many Losses makes it very hard to reach for the Control or to keep it. That&amp;rsquo;s in addition to the gravity of Lasting Losses, which you&amp;rsquo;ll carry over after the Conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a Temporary Loss has been turned face down, it is expended and you may discard the card. However, to keep track of Lasting Loss, you keep Lasting Losses in front of you, even after they have been turned face down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses can only be used against you immediately after you have drawn a card. They do not affect Reserve Cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;example-kaiju-8&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first round of the two-sided Conflict, Levinulon has electrocuting itself, suffering a Lasting Loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s side of the table, the following cards are now visible&lt;/p&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 21&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the next round, Levinulon draws immediately&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-26.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the highest Triumph, which makes Levinulon pretty much unbeatable. That&amp;rsquo;s bad. Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force immediately requests a redraw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levinulon discards the card, hides one of it&amp;rsquo;s Lasting Losses cards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and redraws&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still a Triumph, but one that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has a chance of beating. The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force may decide to overrule this draw or to conserve the Losses for later use. Note that, even once these three cards are hidden, the Lasting Loss remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;example-here-comes-a-new-challenger-5&#34;&gt;Example: Here comes a new challenger&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Balance Breaker Round, Levinulon, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force and the US Covert Mech Operations have each suffered one Temporary Loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the card drawn by the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force is hard to beat, the All Nippon News Network Crew could have decided to use the Temporary Loss of the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force to request a redraw. The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force would have then discarded both the Temporary Loss card and the Triumph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Temporary Loss is now gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-reserve-cards&#34;&gt;Using Reserve Cards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any story, there are major characters/parties and secondary ones. Major characters – including antagonists – are harder to shake away than mere extras. This is represented by parties involved in a conflict having Reserve Cards – or no Reserve Cards for secondary antagonists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A party may use their own Reserve Cards to replace a card that has just been put on the table, or turned, by any party, provided the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the party wishes to replace their own Card, they must narrate how one of their own Aspects, Weaknesses or Losses that are still on the table helps them in this circumstance;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the party wishes to replace the Card of another party, they must narrate how one of the Aspects, Weaknesses or Losses that are still on the table of the other party hinders that party in this circumstance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the Reserve Cards are one materialization of the Aspects, Weaknesses and Losses of all parties involved. If the conditions are met, the party may take one of their Reserve Cards and put it on top of the card that they intend to replace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserve Cards are replenished as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;during the Conflict, whenever you win a round, you can draw a new Reserve Card immediately, as long as you do not go past the number of Reserve Cards on your character sheet;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the end of the Conflict, if you have Conceded, you can restore, you can draw

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as many Reserve Card as were used against you to replace your cards during the Conflict, &lt;em&gt;even if this brings you past the number of cards indicated on your character sheet&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plus one more card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other ways to replenish Reserve Cards out of Conflict, which we won&amp;rsquo;t detail here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-later-round&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju, later round&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has started the Conflict with the following Reserve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levinulon decides that this bid is too powerful and immediately replaces this card with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;handling-multiple-players-or-characters-per-party&#34;&gt;Handling multiple players or characters per party&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most commonly, the player&amp;rsquo;s characters will, together, be one party in the conflict. This does not change the rules above, but it does lead to interesting questions, such as: &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rsquo;s getting that permanent Loss on their character sheet?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rsquo;s spending one Reserve Card?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rsquo;s receiving one Reserve Card?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;drawing-cards&#34;&gt;Drawing Cards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules for drawing remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever a Balance Breaker takes place, players should decide who draws the card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever it is the turn of the player&amp;rsquo;s party to to pass/bid, if the players collectively decide to bid, one of the players must take the responsibility of drawing the card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, whoever drew the last card of the round for the party will receive the entire benefits (in terms of Reserve Cards) and pay the entire cost (in terms of Losses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;losses&#34;&gt;Losses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules for Losses remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Lasting Loss for the party is simple to heal/fix/recover, the second is harder, etc. even if they do not hit the same character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses affect the ability of the entire party to work as a team, so a Card Loss experienced by one character may be used against another character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Wipe Out affects the entire party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reserve-cards&#34;&gt;Reserve Cards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any of the players may only use their own Reserve Cards. If they use a Reserve Card to cover one of their own cards, this must be narrated in relation to one of the Aspects, Weaknesses or Losses of the player&amp;rsquo;s character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the party won the round, the player who drew the last card for the party receives the bonus Reserve Card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserve Cards used by opposing parties to cover the party&amp;rsquo;s cards are accounted for separately for each player. If you, as a player, drew the card that was covered, the Reserve Card gets, upside down, in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conceding-and-reframing-the-conflict&#34;&gt;Conceding and Reframing the Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A character may Concede the Conflict individually. If so, the character gets one Reserve Card for Conceding, plus one for each Reserve Card used by opposing parties to cover the player&amp;rsquo;s cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the party Concedes the Conflict as a whole, this is equivalent to each character Conceding individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a single character manages to Reframe the Conflict, this affects all parties for the entire Conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
