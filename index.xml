      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the Delphi Council approached the Pan-Pacific Alliance to
join forces against the Invasion, Pan-Pacifica rejected the
invitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Pan-Pacific Alliance had another plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/documents/torg/covert-edf-1.pdf&#34;&gt;The Earth Defense Force.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fifth preview of a &lt;em&gt;Torg: Eternity&lt;/em&gt; Infiniverse Supplement called
&lt;em&gt;The Covert Reality War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At its core, the Delphi Council is the CIA, and it is no secret
that the CIA is not very popular in many Muslim countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when Muslims decided that they needed to protect themselves,
something happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/documents/torg/covert-federation-1.pdf&#34;&gt;Welcome to the Federation of Saladin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fourth preview of a &lt;em&gt;Torg: Eternity&lt;/em&gt; Infiniverse Supplement called
&lt;em&gt;The Covert Reality War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Delphi Council is clearly a US-centric Agency, so it was only a matter of
time before a EU-backed counterpart arose. But with Spain presiding over the
EU and Spain having granted Emergency Powers to Jean Malraux, what will
this Agency look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/documents/torg/covert-bureau-1.pdf&#34;&gt;Welcome to the Storm Office – Le Bureau des Tempêtes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a third preview of a &lt;em&gt;Torg: Eternity&lt;/em&gt; Infiniverse Supplement called
&lt;em&gt;The Covert Reality War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Torg is a game of world-hopping. One day, the Heroes are in Aysle, the next one in Yucatan,
and the day after, in a VTOL jet bringing them to an oil rig in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what are they doing here? What about these frenemy agencies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a second preview of a Torg: The Covert Reality War, dedicated to the theater
of operations of the Reality Choir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/documents/torg/covert-theaters-1.pdf&#34;&gt;Theaters of Operations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ronin Time Bureaucrats: The Most Benevolent Administrators</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/rtb-most-benevolent-administrators/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 16:33:50 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/rtb-most-benevolent-administrators/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Most Benevolent Administrators&lt;/strong&gt; are believed to be leftovers of a dead branch of the &lt;strong&gt;Time Bureaucracy&lt;/strong&gt;. They may be found scattered around time and space. While they look quite harmless – who would fear something that appears essentially to be photocopier on wheel tracks – the sheets of paper that they print sometimes make them very dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Benevolent Administrators are generally Poets and Philosophers, able of deep reflections on the nature of the human psyche, among others. They are also extremely perceptive and their writings are eloquent as very few human beings can be. Surprisingly, they often use these skills, combined, for the perceived benefits of others. Wherever a Most Benevolent Administrator shows up – which may be pretty much anywhere in Space·Time – expect that within a few months, people will be inventing Social Security and Universities and Parliaments, building Cathedrals, Towers of Babel and Starships and Utopias. Sadly, very few civilizations can survive such a level of ascension, and the rule of a Most Benevolent Administrator most often ends with bloody revolutions, invasions, cataclysms or self-immolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Benevolent Administrators are rather peaceful, and will not incite a civilization to war when it could be using its own life essence to produce immortal pieces of art. The only known exception is when two Most Benevolent Administrators show up in the same Time·Space – this always ends up in a savage war to the last man standing, for obscure philosophical or religious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Plotonomicon: Creating Worlds</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/plotonomicon-creating-worlds/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Nov 2018 20:10:37 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the Plotonomicon, creating a world is, much like creating a character, a series of Questions.
Where creating a player&amp;rsquo;s character is generally a dialogue between the GM and that player,
creating a world is one that involves everybody around the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to decide how much detail you want to put in your world –
there&amp;rsquo;s no limit to how much time you can spend creating a world, if you enjoy doing so,
but maybe you want to use that world immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;quick-start-world&#34;&gt;Quick Start World&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story has started. You have promised an epic of sword &amp;amp; sorcery, the characters are ready,
you just don&amp;rsquo;t have a world upon which to unleash them. So let&amp;rsquo;s spend the least amount of time
to get the story rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple Question: &lt;em&gt;Where do we start&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player A draws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-76.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-76.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 76, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;Obviously, we start with some kind of forest. &lt;em&gt;Fading into myth&lt;/em&gt;? Maybe some kind of mystical forest that has somehow vanished from time and space.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;What happens in the forest?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-51.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-51.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 51, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Since this Earth is square, I believe that the forest works with different laws of physics than the main world. That&amp;rsquo;s not very surprising, as this is a mystical forest. It is also a &lt;em&gt;Stationary Earth&lt;/em&gt;, so&amp;hellip; for some reason, the forest has stayed in the same place while the world was moving. Perhaps due to different laws of physics, it only appears in some season, when Earth is in the right position in its orbit around the Sun?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;All of this is useful, but don&amp;rsquo;t forget to answer Player A&amp;rsquo;s Question!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Oh, yes, what&amp;rsquo;s happening &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the forest. Well, &lt;em&gt;New life into old ideas&lt;/em&gt;. Or instead of ideas, this could be spirits. So, the spirits of the forest have been dormant for a long time, and they are returning to life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Very well. That&amp;rsquo;s almost sufficient to get started. I just have one last Question: &lt;em&gt;What are the heroes doing here?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-44.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-44.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 44, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re following rumors of a monster. Actually, we&amp;rsquo;re following the tracks of some kind of monster. This lead us here. We&amp;rsquo;re probably lost now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous things that you do not know about this forest. What do the spirits look
or sound like? What do they want? How will they react to the heroe&amp;rsquo;s intrusion? What does
the monster look like? Why are the spirits asleep?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All good Questions, which may be answered during the story, as the characters encounter
these inhabitants and the monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, you have enough to get the story rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-game-is-world-building&#34;&gt;The game is world-building&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the story is about the world itself, rather than its inhabitants. Or perhaps,
you enjoy a session to build the world before telling stories in it. If so, you have
more time ahead of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, let&amp;rsquo;s play Question ping-pong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;What caused the spirits to wake-up?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-15.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-15.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 15, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Great Progress&lt;/em&gt;. So, we are talking about Earth, our Earth or one that looks very much like it. Somehow, scientific discoveries are awakening the Spirits of Nature trapped in the Forest. Probably something related to space, maybe satellites?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;What trapped the Spirits of Nature in the Forest?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-73.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-73.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 73, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;Old age, simply. The Spirits of Nature were born with Nature herself, and progressively grew old. They went to
the Forest to die, until that satellite woke them up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;How long have the Spirits of Nature being trapped here?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-77.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-77.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 77, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;Since the fire lizards came out of the seas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;Where is the Forest, exactly?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Mmmh&amp;hellip;. &lt;em&gt;Some kind of street performer&lt;/em&gt;? Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough about statues to be sure, but it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s from South-East Asia. So, I would say&amp;hellip; Hong Kong. The Forest now covers the city of Hong Kong! Also, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;gracious and deadly&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure exactly what that means, but for some reason, people are attracted to the Forest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;When did the Forest show up?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;Oh, that one is tricky. I see a bat-winged serpent-woman, a man in armor, a window, also &lt;em&gt;We need to talk&lt;/em&gt;, etc. Any ideas?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t there a year of the dragon? Or a year of the serpent?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Something related to a breakup?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;The retrocession of Hong Kong to the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll go with the breakup, but figuratively. Say, there was an earthquake somewhere in South-East Asia a few months ago. One of the worst in history, and it caused massive Tsunamis. That&amp;rsquo;s when the Forest arrived in Hong Kong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d like to return to the Spirits of Nature. I wonder, &lt;em&gt;What are the Spirits of Nature going to do?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;Obviously, they are going to cross the water. They are going to colonize Mainland China, because &lt;em&gt;No Obstacle is Too Great&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;I wonder, &lt;em&gt;What is the situation in the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Too much of a good thing?&lt;/em&gt; This could be nature recovering, or the country being so rich that it can&amp;rsquo;t cope with internal societal changes. Actually, why choose? This is a period of social reforms, where each day is full of promises, where pollution decreases, life expectancy increases&amp;hellip; and in this setting, nobody cares all that much about Hong Kong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s stop here. We have our Earth, nearly unchanged. We have a mysterious forest, peopled by entirely alien Spirits of Nature. We have a huge earthquake, which may have been caused by the Forest, or may have caused its reappearance. We have one of the largest and richest cities in the world, essentially vanished. We have the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China, ignoring the threat that grows in its own South. We have some Fire Lizards, which may return at some point in the story. It is quite possible that adventurers of all sorts are converging on Hong Kong, hoping to rescue survivors, plunder its riches or study its ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, we already have a rich seed for a setting, and we may continue as long as we have Questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-did-we-do-that&#34;&gt;How did we do that?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual with the Plotonomicon, once we have the right Questions, everything else fits nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among starting Questions, we recommend something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where do we start?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does this place look like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does it feel like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is the main problem?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How did that happen?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is going to happen now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are people doing about it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What can the heroes do about it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and from then, if you have time to proceed, Question ping-pong!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Stronger Together</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-parties/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 13:48:15 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Together, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-prepared, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed,
well-trained, that&amp;rsquo;s even better. Well, whenever you group be together, or ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re well-prepared,
well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed, well-trained or pretty much anything else, you are
&lt;strong&gt;Creating an Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-parties/Danse_macabre_by_Michael_Wolgemut.png&#34; alt=&#34;Dance of Death by Michael Wolgemut – Public Domain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most things in N-Dimensional Tourists, Advantages are basically Aspects and may represent
just about anything that makes sense in-story. It could be a strong character providing the
team with &lt;strong&gt;Muscle&lt;/strong&gt; during a streetfight, or a &lt;strong&gt;Hand-up for climbing&lt;/strong&gt;. It could be an
anime scientist building &lt;strong&gt;Mechs to defeat the alien invasion&lt;/strong&gt;, or a super-villain scientist
providing &lt;strong&gt;Green Rocks that absorb Ultraman&amp;rsquo;s power&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declare what Advantage you are creating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating that Advantage is a Challenge, so reach an agreement with the GM on Reach and Risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempt to Meet the Challenge, using the regular rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have succeeded, you have created the advantage. Congratulations, the Aspect is created,
write it down on an index card. Depending on your Success Ranks, you may need to adjust the
actual Aspect written down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have Success Ranks, leave the cards that gave you these ranks on the index card. Ignore
orientation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a Cost, you have also created an Aspect that works against you. Write
it down on an index card. The GM draws as many Sleeve Cards and puts them on the
index card. These Sleeve Cards are meant to be used against you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;example-chess-match&#34;&gt;Example: Chess Match&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After realizing that Lady Buckingham didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well against Lord Dervon during the early
match, Lord Robson (PC) has decided to help
Lady Buckingham as best as he can, by attempting to draw the attention of Lord Devon away from
the game. For this purpose, Lord Robson will use his mirror watch to reflect light onto Lord
Dervon&amp;rsquo;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t look particularly hard, but it&amp;rsquo;s also going to be a minor distraction,
right? I mean, once he realizes what&amp;rsquo;s going on, he can simply ask you politely to stop. Also,
if people realize what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, you&amp;rsquo;re going to look a bit childish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Well, people know me as an eccentric, so looking childish won&amp;rsquo;t hurt my reputation
overmuch.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok. So the difficulty is Fair (2), let me draw cards for the Challenge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-44.png&#34;

        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 44, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, getting a narrow light straight on your mirror in this crowded room full of statues
and decorations is actually a little bit more complicated than it looks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-13.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-13.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 13, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Also, did I mention that the room is crowded?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;As this is sleight of hand, I&amp;rsquo;ll be drawing my Good (3) Serpents. That&amp;rsquo;s already two reversed
cards, which isn&amp;rsquo;t very good for me. Ah, well, let&amp;rsquo;s draw.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-23.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-23.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 23, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;So, on the upside, I am succeeding, despite all the difficulties, at getting some light in
Lord Dervon&amp;rsquo;s eyes. That&amp;rsquo;s thanks to a mirror representing Hamlet&amp;rsquo;s Ophelia. It might be a little
visible, though.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-11.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-11.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 11, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Ouch, such a crowd! Someone just elbowed me in an attempt to look better, so I&amp;rsquo;ll need to move.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-46.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-46.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 46, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Yes, definitely a better position. From here, I can point the light straight into his face.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-73.png&#34;

                alt=&#34;Card number 73, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; and help myself to some of this delicious champagne.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Well, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stop here. So, while I do manage to get some light into Dervon&amp;rsquo;s eyes,
I have had to move a bit around the room to do so, which attracts a few stares as I elbow and
get elbowed in return. I have decided on my course of action and will not relent, though.
As an Advantage, I&amp;rsquo;ll pick &lt;strong&gt;A little twinkling in the eye&lt;/strong&gt;, with Average (1), so one card.
And for a disadvantage, I&amp;rsquo;ll pick &lt;strong&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s a bit rude, isn&amp;rsquo;t he?&lt;/strong&gt;, also Average (1), so you
get one card.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;You have two unique cards, which one do you pick?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;They are equivalent, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;In terms of probabilities, yes, they are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Well, say, this one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-73.png&#34;

        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GM also draws one card for &lt;strong&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s a bit rude, isn&amp;rsquo;t he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Levinulon has destroyed the Bank of Japan, as well as a number of other buildings, before the
Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force managed to attract its attention. By now, however, both the Infantry
(PC) and the Air Force (PC) have managed to deploy. Neither will be able to bear the brunt of the
combat against Levinulon, but that&amp;rsquo;s ok, they are both going to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;I think that our main role at this stage will be to evacuate the Civilians, to make
sure that the Mechs can use their weapons without causing collateral damage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Can I wait until I know how the Infantry is doing before deciding whether I&amp;rsquo;m here
to carpet bomb Levinulon or to distract it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sure, so, Infantry, your Reach is to evacuate all Civilians from combat areas in time. What
kind of Risk do you foresee?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Well, our forces are spread thin, so we might not succeed at evacuating everyone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sure, but that&amp;rsquo;s already covered by the Reach and the Rank of the Challenge. For Risk, I&amp;rsquo;d
say that you need all your vehicles and all your men, and you&amp;rsquo;re pretty sure that you&amp;rsquo;re going
to have casualties in your ranks. Right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;How am I going to have casualties?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, if you send your men to evacuate Civilians, this means that they have to evacuate last,
right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Oh, sure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, so the combat line isn&amp;rsquo;t moving very fast, but there are lots of Civilians, so the
difficulty will be Good (3).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Alright. Can I use my Superb (5) Rock for authority?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Definitely.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GM draws for the Obstacle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;So, &lt;em&gt;Too many secrets&lt;/em&gt; – in the area where the conflict has moved, there are lots
of small alleys, little houses, people living in basements due to high rent. Sounds like
Infantry will have difficulties reaching everyone in time. In some places, it looks even
like a small hanging city, with planks and scaffolding used to access some of the houses
(&lt;em&gt;Show of Skills&lt;/em&gt;). The maps for the area are clearly not very good (&lt;em&gt;Lack of Precision&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry draws:&lt;/p&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Well, my officers are pretty good, thank you very much. They didn&amp;rsquo;t reach their
rank (&lt;em&gt;Rising to Power&lt;/em&gt;) out of supidity, but thanks to their ability to organize their
soldiers even in high-pressure, low-information situations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry draws:&lt;/p&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that this area is full of drug dens and low-grade brothels,
but my men are doing their work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Forth reversed card, first reports of losses. Vehicles were destroyed under the
feet of the beast. But we soldier on!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Communications are more complicated. The battlefield has reached us, isolating units
from their officers and from each other, but we will soldier on!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;But I have &lt;em&gt;Absolute Trust&lt;/em&gt; in my officers and soldiers, and they prove that they
deserve this trust, by saving a considerable number of civilians. Go ahead, Tokyo Mechanized
Defense Force, beat the monster!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;So, it looks like have taken some losses of both material and men in this labyrinth,
Good soldiers who could not get away in time after having saved the lives of so many civilians.
You will be remembered!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry writes down &lt;strong&gt;The battlefield has been evacuated&lt;/strong&gt; and adds the pair on the index card:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure

            alt=&#34;Card number 65&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infantry may now give one or both of these cards to any character, as long as it makes sense that
the character is supported by the Aspect. The idea is to hand these cards to the Tokyo Mechanized
Defense Force, but the Air Force could be interested, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry adds &lt;strong&gt;The Infantry suffered losses&lt;/strong&gt;, on which the GM may now add two cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Since &lt;strong&gt;The battlefield has been evacuated&lt;/strong&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide air support, bombing
Levinulon as often as possible without hurting the Infantry or the Tokyo Mechanized Defense
Force.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, you have serious firepower at hand, so you could possibly hurt Levinulon severely.
On the other hand, you risk accidentally bombing either the Infantry or the Tokyo Mechanized
Defense Force, resulting in serious losses. Or maybe you wish to reduce your Risk and Reach?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Nah, let&amp;rsquo;s take chances.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, so, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be Fairly (2) easy, with all your high-tech equipment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Cool. Should I use my Fair (2) Paper for intelligent strikes or my Superb (5) Serpent
for dogfighting and speed?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Depends on your style. If you&amp;rsquo;re playing it fast and furious, you could youse the Serpent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Serpent it is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM Draws&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Ok, I&amp;rsquo;ll draw.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM takes one of the cards from &lt;strong&gt;The Infantry suffered losses&lt;/strong&gt;, covering one of his cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Since the &lt;strong&gt;Infantry has suffered losses&lt;/strong&gt; of vehicles and equipment, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Madness&lt;/em&gt; down there.
You&amp;rsquo;re going to receive contradictory reports from the battlefield, which don&amp;rsquo;t let you aim as well
as you want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t think so! I can use my cards to support the Air Force instead of you,
right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;As long as it makes sense in-story, yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;In this case, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; your cards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Thanks to the great job done by the infantry, however, you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly receive precise
dispatches that will make your life easier.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Force Draws:&lt;/p&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is already a Success with an Effect of 2 and a Cost of 0. Pretty good for a single card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;My ace pilots are turning Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s huge size into a handicap, as it cannot turn
quickly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

it. I&amp;rsquo;ll stop here, before I hit my colleagues by accident.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Force writes down &lt;strong&gt;Death from the skies&lt;/strong&gt; and adds three cards:&lt;/p&gt;

        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No Cost!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force plays again, they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use these three cards, which will
undoubtedly considerably tilt the balance!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Aspects and your Sleeve</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-the-sleeve/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;While we have met Aspects a few times in this manual, so far,
we have mostly contented ourselves with writing them down.
Some are on your character sheet, some have been used to describe
NPCs, or consequences of actions. In this chapter, we will
discuss further what Aspects &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how they maybe used&lt;/em&gt;,
both for the benefit of your character and against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;aspects-in-narration&#34;&gt;Aspects in Narration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-the-sleeve/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights17.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sani ol-Molk – Sheherazade and the Sultan (from the One Thousand and One Nights) – Public Domain – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspect-are-facts&#34;&gt;Aspect are Facts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, Aspects are Facts. Anything that is written down
as an Aspect is true and undeniable. Aspects are one of the few strict
rules in this game that deal with what may or what may not be narrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a scene has Aspect
&lt;strong&gt;Dark and rainy outside&lt;/strong&gt;, then it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dark and rainy outside,
until there is a good in-story reason for this Aspect to become
irrelevant. At some point it, it is likely that the storm will pass
and the sun will rise. Unless your characters are some kind of weather
control mutants or omnipotent deities – and we&amp;rsquo;re going to assume that
they aren&amp;rsquo;t – this Aspect will stick to the
scene, and any event that takes place during that scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, whatever may happen &lt;em&gt;in a different scene&lt;/em&gt;, for the moment,
it is dark and rainy outside. One of the consequences of this is
that the Players and the GM alike are &lt;em&gt;forbidden&lt;/em&gt; from narrating
anything that contradicts this Fact. If you recall, a Challenge
is a single scene. Consequently, if the current scene has heroes
fighting vampires, and if they need a ray of sun to get rid of
these pesky light-allergic creatures, that is too bad for them,
because this cannot happen for the moment. The vampires might
suffer negative Effects from the Challenge, but the Reach of
the heroes will not, in any manner, offer the ability of exposing
vampires to the sun. Perhaps, after this Challenge, the scene
may be changed and altered, the clouds will split, dawn will
rise and the vampires will suffer from it. But not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this works both ways: if the heroes are the vampires,
fighting petty vampire hunters, regardless of the Cost of the
Challenge, the GM is forbidden from having the sun rise on
the now heroic bloodsuckers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspects-are-permissions&#34;&gt;Aspects are Permissions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as an Aspect closes some narrative avenues, an Aspect opens
others. Whether PC or NPC, a &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt; will, by
definition, know everything there is to know about being an
assassin and have access to all the equipment, money and contacts
that a professional assassin should have. Whenever the character
is involved in a Challenge, this Aspect will let the Player or GM
narrate both successes and failures as those of a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is true for a &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt; is, of course, even
more true whenever superpowers are involved, whether the character
is the &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Seas&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;World-class telekinetic&lt;/strong&gt;, the
&lt;strong&gt;Youngest Witchmistress of her Generation&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;Bumbling
Time Traveler&lt;/strong&gt;. These Aspects authorize you to narrate actions
that most characters in the setting wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, in any Challenge, Aspects have considerable impact
on Reach and Risk. As a &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt;, you may be able to
snipe the &lt;strong&gt;Modern Necromancer&lt;/strong&gt; before he raises an army of the
dead (Reach), but this Aspect won&amp;rsquo;t help you cast a counter-spell
(also Reach). As a &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Seas&lt;/strong&gt;, you may be able to shrug
anything that the whale hunters throw at you (Cost), but you may
suffer considerably if you can&amp;rsquo;t save the oiler ship (also Cost).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspects-and-balance&#34;&gt;Aspects and Balance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be tempting to assume that Aspects should make draws
easier, but they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t – simply to maintain the game somewhat
balanced and playable despite differences of power scale
between characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, for instance, a super-hero team with a &lt;strong&gt;Indestructible
Super-strong Flying Warrior Demi-goddess&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;Skilled archer
with trick arrows&lt;/strong&gt;, both of them PCs. Imagine them fighting
side-by-side against an &lt;strong&gt;Alien, Multi-bodied, Civilization-destroying Robot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of relative power, yes, the Demi-goddess is impossibly
stronger, and faster, than the Archer. In terms of game, though,
how fun would it for the players if only one could succeed their draws,
simply because of different Aspects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason for which, in movies and comics and novels and
stories of all kind that feature characters of different power levels,
each major character has the opportunity to affect the outcome of
a conflict. This is the reason for which, in N-Dimensional Tourists,
the Aspects of the characters do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; influence the Rank of Challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, consider the Challenge of attacking the Robot&amp;rsquo;s near-indestructible
Unobtainium body. The Robot is pretty slow and attacking it is not very
hard – in fact, the Rank of that Challenge is probably only Good (3). The
difficulty, in this case, is not in the attack, but in doing something
meaningful with it. As we have seen above, Aspects may very well influence
the Reach and Cost of a Challenge. So, while the Demi-goddess&amp;rsquo;s Reach allows
her to reasonably &lt;em&gt;Reduce the mobility of the Unobtainium Body even further
by damaging its limbs&lt;/em&gt;, the Archer&amp;rsquo;s trick explosive arrows
allow him to reasonably &lt;em&gt;Weaken the ground around the Robot, making it
fall into the sewers, where its mobility will be greatly reduced.&lt;/em&gt; If
the Demi-goddess attacks with unarmed combat, she may Risk &lt;em&gt;Being grappled
and immobilized by the Unobtainium Body&lt;/em&gt;. The Archer remains afar, so risks
very little for himself, but his strategy could prove &lt;em&gt;Dangerous for the
civilians still in the area&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus is Balance narratively maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-sleeve-economy&#34;&gt;The Sleeve Economy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-the-sleeve/639px-Poker_cheating_20170611.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Santeri Viinamäki – A poker card in your Sleeve – Licensed under  Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen that each player starts a session by drawing three Sleeve Cards.
We have also seen that player can receive Sleeve Cards by conceding Challenges.
What we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen yet is how these Sleeve Cards are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;compelling-aspects&#34;&gt;Compelling Aspects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider our &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt;. What are the chances that there&amp;rsquo;s
an Interpol Taskforce after her? What are the chances that she already
knows the Di Carpa family, having already executed a contract for them?
Consider our &lt;strong&gt;Dark and rainy outside&lt;/strong&gt;
scene. What is the chance that this will lead to a blizzard? Consider
a character suffering from unhealed &lt;strong&gt;Leg Trauma&lt;/strong&gt;. What are the chances
that he&amp;rsquo;ll have to stop the chase due to terrible pain? Consider a
doorway, covered with bloody glyphs, through which a &lt;strong&gt;Hypnotic song&lt;/strong&gt;
may be heard. What are the chances that one of the heroes will listen
to the song of the siren and cross the threshold? Consider a setting
in which, because of Paradoxes, &lt;strong&gt;Killing Time-Travelers is More Trouble than it is Worth&lt;/strong&gt;.
What are the chances that the Robotic Overlords will capture and interrogate
the outmatched heroes, rather than executing them outright?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as Aspects enable and forbid stories from taking place, they can be
used to make something happen – or have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick the Aspect you wish to Compel. It can be any Aspect, belonging to
the scene, a PC, a NPC, an object&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick one of your Sleeve Cards. If you are the GM, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck, you
have an unlimited number of Sleeve Cards in the Space·Time Deck in
front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narrate &amp;ldquo;Since [the Aspect is true], chances are that [something else,
based on both this Aspect and the card you picked, is also true].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This mechanism is called a &lt;strong&gt;Compel&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are Compelling yourself,
a NPC, an object, a scene, or if you
are Compelling a PC to make their life easier&amp;hellip; the Sleeve Card goes
into the Space·Time Deck. If you are Compelling a PC to make their
life harder, the Sleeve Card is for that PC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the Compel is on a PC, that player may reject the Compel, in which
case you get to keep your Sleeve Card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compels require no Challenge. Once a Compel has been accepted, it becomes
automatically true, generally a new Aspect if that&amp;rsquo;s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For players, Compels typically serve to alter the story and make their
life easier. This is, often, how a character happens to already know a
place or a story or a NPC. This is also, sometimes, how a group of adventurers
hired to enter a dungeon and look for an artifact, happens to have already
acquired the map of the dungeon – or possibly already beaten it – on their
spare time, hence requiring the GM to adapt and improvise a new objective
for the plot. Or maybe, for a Demi-goddess, this is how you just decide
that a minor supervillain is no match for you, by simply Compelling your
victory in hand-to-hand combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the GM, Compels serve several objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are a good way to introduce NPCs, factions, objects and tie
them to the background of a PC;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are a good way to introduce new complications in the life of
the heroes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are a good way to make a PC do something that the player knows
is stupide, but that makes entire sense in-story (recall that the
player may refuse);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the heroes are running low on Sleeve Cards, it is a good mechanism
to reload them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note for GMs: as a general guideline, if a player answers your narration
by &amp;ldquo;Oh, no!&amp;rdquo; and then eagerly takes the Sleeve Card offered, your Compel
was probably spot on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspects-may-be-tricked&#34;&gt;Aspects may be Tricked&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way, there is another way to use Sleeve Cards and Aspects,
it&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;strong&gt;Tricking&lt;/strong&gt;, and it helps you during Challenges, by
letting you cover a card that you have just drawn or that your
opponent has just drawn, with one of the cards up your Sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick the Aspect you wish to &lt;strong&gt;Trick&lt;/strong&gt;. It could be one of your
Aspects, or it could belong to your opponent, to the scene, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick one of your Sleeve Cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpret the card you&amp;rsquo;re covering and narrate it as what you
    have just escaped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpret the card you&amp;rsquo;re using and narrate it as what ended
    up happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narrate how the Aspect saved you, or helped save you from the
    one to the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the Challenge draws all cards at once. You may cover any
(or all) of the cards after they have all been drawn. You can only
use each Aspect once per Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule works both for the Players and the GM. However, for this
use, the GM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an unlimited Sleeve. The size of the Sleeve
depends on the importance of the Challenge. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss this in the
chapter dedicated to setting up advanced Challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role-Playing Game Pitch: Kingdom Came</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/an-idea-kingdom-came/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2018 11:56:38 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rejoice, for the Kingdom of Death is no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was first reported Last Thursday, at 0421 GMT and it happened all over the globe: the dead have returned to walk among the living. They are disoriented, surely, and returned from Heaven or Hell or other places, but they are peaceful, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What most of them are no more is &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;. For &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the dead have returned, all since the first step of our kind, or possibly before, and few of them have a body to return to. The fresh ones, the ones who had died just a few moments after the event, those woke up without a pulse and continued their day without realizing that something was amiss. The decayed ones, the ones who had been in the ground or under the water for weeks or years or centuries, those woke up as creatures of their own nightmares, without context or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the rest? Those who had been cremated or destroyed by time or beasts or accident? Well, those had to find something to inhabit, didn&amp;rsquo;t they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, 0421 GMT is now known as the Kingdom Came event. And since Kingdom Came, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; can host a returned human being. It could be your toaster or a book in your library. It could be your favorite earring or your camera. It could be Google or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejoice, for the Kingdom of Death is no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejoice, for the Dead have returned, from Heaven or Hell or other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how will society cope?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plotonomicon: Let&#39;s not prepare anything</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/plotonomicon-the-art-of-not-preparing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Nov 2018 13:29:51 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;All good things start with stories. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a buzzphrase, by the way.
If you are building a story, whether you are role-playing, storytelling for
an audience or writing a book, the story comes first and everything else
tends to follow naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let us start with, once again, a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;hope-renewed&#34;&gt;Hope renewed&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our story is set in a fantasy archipelago inhabited by dozens of sentient
species, and loosely inspired from Ancient Greece, with larger ships.
One by one, the islands have fallen to the powerful and evil Spartan
Legion, whose overlord now rules the archipelago nearly uncontested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/plotonomicon-the-art-of-not-preparing/1024px-Hoplites_fight_Louvre_E735.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kleimachos – Hoplites fighting. Detail from an Attic black-figure hydria, ca. 560 BC–550 BC. – Public Domain – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, these are a few sentences that most GMs could improv before coffee.
We&amp;rsquo;ll see more about preparing/improvising campaigns and settings later.
For the moment, we&amp;rsquo;re only interested in major NPCs, so we&amp;rsquo;ll let the story flow without much
detail and concentrate only in the introduction of these NPCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first player arrives. The GM tells him about the archipelago, the
Spartan Legion, the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;So, what kind of character would you like to play?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 1: &amp;ldquo;Mmmh&amp;hellip; Well, obviously, a future hero. I don&amp;rsquo;t know much
about the setting yet. so let&amp;rsquo;s start with someone who&amp;rsquo;s not involved
in the war at all. Maybe some kind of farmer&amp;rsquo;s kid, eager for adventure.
I&amp;rsquo;ll call him Desmondos.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desmondos doesn&amp;rsquo;t know much about the war&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desmondos grew up on a farm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desmondos is eager for adventure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;entering-the-plot&#34;&gt;Entering the plot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Alright. This story is going to be about you, and the other PCs,
taking an active part in the war against the Spartan Legion.
Desmondos, can you tell me how you &lt;em&gt;enter this plot&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Could I receive a message accidentally? Some magical
message that&amp;rsquo;s meant for an enemy of the Spartan Legion, who
hides on the same island as me, but for some reason, I got the
message, and since I&amp;rsquo;m eager for adventure, I decide to bring
it to the intended recipient?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;That sound good. Player 3 told me that she wants to play
some kind of princess. Let&amp;rsquo;s say it&amp;rsquo;s from her. It will create
the first relationship between your characters. Once Player 3
arrives, we&amp;rsquo;ll see later how she gets drawn into that plot.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how she wants to call her character, but let&amp;rsquo;s
say Erikaia. We&amp;rsquo;ll change the names retroactively if she
doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Yeah, I received a message from Princess Erikaia.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, now tell me more about this message.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Well, it seems to be encrypted somehow. But it&amp;rsquo;s clearly meant
for a general, an enemy of the Spartan Legion, who hides on this island.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sounds good. I&amp;rsquo;ll need a name for this general.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;General Gregorios, of the Free Company.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Free Company fights the Spartan Legion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Gregorios, of the Free Company, hides on this island&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-general&#34;&gt;The General&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few adventures, Desmondos manages to locate General
Gregorios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;So, tell me more about this General Gregorios.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s in his fifties and he&amp;rsquo;s some kind of Paladin. He&amp;rsquo;s very strong, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok. General Gregorios tells you a bit more about the Spartan Legion – basically
what we had established during campaign creation. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s lead by a general
called&amp;hellip; Drakon the Undefeated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Oh, and can Gregorios take me as an apprentice? I want to become a Paladin like him!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Gregorios smiles at your requests and answers &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Well, you have certainly proven worthy. We can give it a try.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GM ponders it a second, and decides that since Gregorios is clearly
much stronger than Desmondos – and all threats should be scaled for
Desmondos and his friends rather than for Gregorios – Gregorios doesn&amp;rsquo;t
need a character sheet. If necessary, Gregorios may be used as a &lt;em&gt;bonus&lt;/em&gt;
to make things possible or improve the results of Desmondos&amp;rsquo; actions.
Not creating the character sheet immediately means that the GM is free
to improvise the exact strength and powers of Gregorios as the story
evolves, and to tailor it to wherever the story leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Gregorios is in his fifties.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Gregorios is some kind of Paladin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Gregorios is much stronger than the heroes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Gregorios is now the mentor of Desmondos.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a General Drakon the Undefeated of the Spartan Legion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-threat&#34;&gt;The Threat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once decyphered, the message tells of a terrible threat,
some kind of spell that will forever erase freewill from
the mind of all inhabitants of the archipelago. General
Gregorios is the last hope of the Free Company and the
archipelago. Gregorios and Desmondos decide that they
need a ship to reach the hidden camp of the Free Company,
to warn them of the terrible danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:
- &lt;strong&gt;The Spartan Legion is about to unleash a terrible spell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-challenger-has-arrived&#34;&gt;A new challenger has arrived&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, Player 2 has just arrived!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 2: &amp;ldquo;Sorry about that, I hope you guys started without me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;We certainly did. Desmondos, do you wish to tell Player 2
about what has happened so far?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: [&amp;hellip;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; and so, we arrive to the moment where the heroes are
looking for a way to leave the island and reach the hidden
camp of the Free Company. Does this give you ideas for a
character?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 2: &amp;ldquo;Yeah. Could I be some kind of mercenary&amp;hellip; no, say
a smuggler? I have my own ship, it&amp;rsquo;s small, it&amp;rsquo;s fast, it
can get around the islands quickly and unseen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;That would certainly work. So, your plot introduction is
that you&amp;rsquo;re going to be hired to bring the other heroes to
their destination, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 2: &amp;ldquo;Right. And they don&amp;rsquo;t have money with them, so I&amp;rsquo;m
going to stick with them until they pay me, because I have
debts. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s a good way for me to get out of the way,
because someone might be after me to break my knees or
something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sounds good. Do you have a name?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 2: &amp;ldquo;Mmmmh&amp;hellip; Frankos the Sailor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frankos the Sailor has a small and fast ship.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frankos the Sailor has debts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frankos the Sailor has a contract with Gregorios and Desmondos.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-third-challenger-has-arrived&#34;&gt;A third challenger has arrived&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more adventures, all three characters find themselves
hidden in the hold of Drakon the Undefeated&amp;rsquo;s own ship.
Right on time, Player 3 arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 3: &amp;ldquo;Sorry guys, I told you I&amp;rsquo;d arrive a bit late. Did you
keep me Princess Erikaka, as I asked?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Yes, we did. Player 1, Player 2, can you tell her about
what has happened so far?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player 3, now Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;Ok, then it&amp;rsquo;s simple. I&amp;rsquo;m prisoner in that ship!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Tell me more, why are you held prisoner?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m one of the leaders of the Anti-Spartan Legion&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;We decided to call it the Free Company.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;Ok, I&amp;rsquo;m one of the leaders of the Free Company. Also, I got word
from a terrible threat&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Oh, we got that one, too. There&amp;rsquo;s a freewill-wiping spell,
and the Spartan Legion is going to launch it soon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;Er&amp;hellip; right. So, the bad guy&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; General Drakon the Undefeated!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re annoying. No, his boss, The Demagogue, ordered me arrested.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sure. You managed to somehow send a message to General Gregorios before
being arrested, with details about that spell.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erikaia is prisoner in Drakon&amp;rsquo;s ship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erikaia is one of the leaders of the Free Company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon the Undefeated&amp;rsquo;s boss is called The Demagogue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erikaia, Desmondos and Frankos manage to remain hidden but General Gregorios
isn&amp;rsquo;t so lucky. He&amp;rsquo;s somehow separated from the PCs, who can only witness
from afar as Drakon the Undefeated shows up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Drakon. You recognize him easily from the description given
by Erikaia. He&amp;rsquo;s strong, he wears a mask, and he seems to be the
same kind of Paladin as General Gregorios.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon the Undefeated wears a mask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon the Undefeated is also some kind of Paladin, like General Gregorios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short battle, General Gregorios is mercilessly executed by Drakon
the Undefeated, while the heroes manage to escape the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon the Undefeated is über-badass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;towards-the-finale&#34;&gt;Towards the finale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/plotonomicon-the-art-of-not-preparing/Lycurgus_of_Sparta.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jacques-Louis David – Lycurgus of Sparta – Public Domain – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankos the Sailor manages to bring Princess Erikaia
and Desmondos to the Free Company. Ensues a discussion on
battle tactics, led by Princess Erikaia and the leader
of the Free Company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;One second, Erikaia. Tell me something about the leader of the Free Company.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erikaia: &amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s called Myra Medea. Also, she&amp;rsquo;s dressed in white.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myra Medea is the leader of the Free Company&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myra Medea dresses in white&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After debate, the conclusion is that the only way to save
the archipelago is to send several groups of the Free
Company – including the PCs – to board Drakon&amp;rsquo;s ship,
carrying counterspells, hoping that one will be able
to apply one of these counterspells to the pentagram
that will be used to carry out the spell. Of course,
the attack must be launched immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-grand-finale&#34;&gt;The Grand Finale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/plotonomicon-the-art-of-not-preparing/battle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Giovanni Battista Scultori – Battle between the Acheans and the Trojans – Public Domain – Source: Picryl&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big battle ensues. Drakon the Undefeated illustrates his strength
by killing dozens of unnamed NPCs (since Drakon the Undefeated
has been established to be so very powerful, the GM and players
conspire to tell how he always has something more important
to do than chasing the PCs). Eventually, once most friendly NPCs
are dead, Drakon the Undefeated decides to attack the PCs, but
an explosion throws him overboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counterspell is launched, the spell is averted, everybody rejoices,
and Drakon swears revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulation, heroes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for you, reader, you may have realized a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the major NPCs of this story (Drakon, Gregorios, the Demagogue, Myra Medea)
didn&amp;rsquo;t need much in terms of character creation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with a few tricks, the GM managed to entirely avoid character sheets
for these characters;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most of the creation for the characters was actually done by the players,
rather than the GM;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you already know this story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes, did we forgot to mention it? We should thank our actors, who
    came specially from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Episode IV to take the exact same
    roles in this antique variants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luke Skywalker (as Desmondos);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Princess Leia (as Princess Erikaia);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi (as General Gregorios);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Darth Vader (as Drakon the Undefeated);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Han Solo (as Frankos the Sailor);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emperor Palpatine (as the Demagogue);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senator Mon Mothma (as Myra Medea);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-spartan-legion-strikes-back&#34;&gt;The Spartan Legion Strikes Back&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/plotonomicon-the-art-of-not-preparing/greece.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Statue of a Greek Soldier – Public Domain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-grand-finale&#34;&gt;Another Grand Finale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is not over, of course. Eventually, Drakon the Undefeated will manage
to trick Princess Erikaia and Frankos the Sailor into a trap and lure Desmondos
the, er, Hoplite of Light into a hopeless fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our example is a Role-Playing Game, this scene may now go two ways. Either it
can become a by-the-book round-by-round combat, or the GM and Players may come
up with something a bit more inventive. In fact, since Drakon is so much stronger
than Desmondos, a by-the-book combat scene would probably be rather boring, with
Desmondos&amp;rsquo; player rolling attack after attack, only for them to be deflected by
a Drakon who could certainly kill Desmondos in a single half-hearted blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s be a little more inventive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;I have bad news for you, Desmondos. Drakon is really, really, really much
stronger than you. You don&amp;rsquo;t stand a chance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Er&amp;hellip; right. Should I create a new character?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Not quite yet. We&amp;rsquo;re going to tell together how you fail to beat Desmondos,
but he won&amp;rsquo;t kill you. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll be captured, as Erikaia and Frankos, or
perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll manage to escape, I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet, but let&amp;rsquo;s face it, you have
no way of actually beating Drakon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Oh, right. Escaping or being captured, sure, that sounds good. Do
I get to pick now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, you can, if you – as a player – have a strong preference, but otherwise,
we&amp;rsquo;ll see as the scene progresses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Sounds good. Should I roll for attacks?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound really useful, but you can describe your attacks, and how
Drakon evades or deflects them. But in fact, this scene is more a conversation
with the swordfighting as a bit of background noise, rather than a traditional
fight scene.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;I run at him, yelling « YOU WILL NEVER GET ME, DRAKON! » while I
attempt to stab him with my spear, but he deflects it effortlessly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM as Drakon: &amp;ldquo;Oh, but I will, young Hoplite. My master, the Demagogue, has
foreseen it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, it would be surprising if this exact dialog took place during a Storytelling
performance or a Writing session, but the reasoning applies just as well to either case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;As I drop my spear and try to go under his shield with my dagger,
« I know that you killed my father ! », but he manages be able to catch
my wrist and force me to drop the dagger.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM as Drakon: &amp;ldquo;Who told you that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Could Gregorios have told me that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM, taking notes: &amp;ldquo;Sure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Gregorios told me, before you murdered him, like the coward you are!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM as Drakon, with a smirk: &amp;ldquo;That old fool lied to you, Desmondos. I AM YOUR FATHER.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facts established so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gregorios claims that Drakon killed Desmondos&amp;rsquo; father&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon claims that he&amp;rsquo;s Desmondos&amp;rsquo; father&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drakon claims that the Demagogue has somehow foreseen the capture of Desmondos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time to end the scene, by the way. Are you going to be captured, injured,
are you going to escape?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;I think he actually broke my wrist. Let me draw a card to find out how
I manage to escape.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-22.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-22.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;We were fighting close to this gaping hole, right? &lt;strong&gt;Being ready, always&lt;/strong&gt;,
can I have had time to look at the bottom of the hole and realize it communicates
with the sea?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Yep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desmondos: &amp;ldquo;Then I take one step backwards and drop into the hole. The fall will
certainly hurt me, but I hope that my friends can rescue me in their ship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Very well. When he realizes what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do, Drakon the Undefeated
attemps to grab you, but he&amp;rsquo;s just one tiny instant too late, and by then, you
are already falling down. Falling down is the last thing you remember. You&amp;rsquo;ll
lose consciousness when hitting the water.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;subverting-round-based-combat&#34;&gt;Subverting round-based combat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have done here is subverting the round-based combat (hero acts, bad guys
act, hero acts, bad guys act, &amp;hellip;) dear to many role-playing games, in particular
video games, but also to many action movies and rephrasing this encounter as a conversation
between Desmondos and Drakon. For one thing, the combat would have made no sense,
as Drakon is so much more powerful than Desmondos. In a role-playing game, a combat
scene would have been both frustrating and limiting. Regardless of storytelling
format, making it a conversation made it interesting: the characters exchanged both
threats and informations, moving the plot forwards. While we do not know, at this
stage, whether Drakon is telling the truth, he undoubtedly had a good reason for
his claims. Investigating the relationship between Drakon and Desmondos sounds like
a very nice hook for the next part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, once again, letting the player (or, in other formats, the audience) decide
the rhythm of the fight and the mean of escape of Desmondos both avoid the frustration
of this one-sided fight and setup the means of regaining hope in the rest of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and in a role-playing format, it also means that we still don&amp;rsquo;t need a detailed
character sheet for Drakon the Undefeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll stop the story of Archipelago Wars here, on this apparent defeat of the heroes,
and we leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine just exactly how much
needs to be prepped ahead of time about the characters of this story for Episode VI,
&lt;em&gt;Return of the Hoplite of Light&lt;/em&gt;. Hint: we can get away with the answer &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;things-we-did&#34;&gt;Things we did&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we have rewritten Star Wars to examine a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introducing major characters / Player&amp;rsquo;s Characters &lt;em&gt;into the plot&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introducing antagonists and supporting characters / Non-Player Characters &lt;em&gt;into the plot&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;starting with a bare bones idea of a character and progressively coming up with the details;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turning NPC encounters into obstacles, rather than fights;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoiding character sheets for NPCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that if you have time to create detailed backstories and/or
character sheets ahead of time, and if you enjoy this task, you are of course
welcome to do so. But hey, this is a book about improv – so if you need to
improv, or if you just don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy spending time prepping characters, know that
you can very easily get away without doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we concentrated on NPCs, the techniques introduced here work just as
well for other parts of the story, including places, factions and the plot
itself. We&amp;rsquo;ll see more in further chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Meeting Challenges</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-overcoming/</link>

&lt;p&gt;So your character needs to find a key, lost somewhere
in the mess left by the previous owner, or perhaps to
pick the lock. Or maybe that piano needs to be moved
into the living room, or you need to find a way through
an opaque bureaucratic process, or to look innocent in front
of a judge, or intimidating in front of a lowly thug.
Or perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re fishing in a river or piloting
your starship or settling a duel with another Musketeer
before the Guards of the Cardinal show up? Or perhaps
your character is an entire religion, attempting to
gain converts in a new land, or a team of medics and
researchers, fighting step by step against an unknown
pandemic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-overcoming/Turk-engraving5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image of a copper engraving from Karl Gottlieb von Windisch&#39;s 1783 book Briefe über den Schachspieler des Hrn. von Kempelen, nebst drei Kupferstichen die diese berühmte Maschine vorstellen. - Public Domain - Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset&lt;/a&gt;,
all these things are called &lt;strong&gt;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;, and are resolved
with a single rule. This rule
determines whether the characters succeed, fail or give
up, and whether their attempt attracts any kind of Complication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting a Challenge is something that only player&amp;rsquo;s characters
do. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss below what happens how to resolve the actions
of non-player character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;rsquo;ll see, meeting a Challenge is a very generic mechanism
which may be used for pretty much any purpose or scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;setting-up-the-challenge-part-1&#34;&gt;Setting up the Challenge, part 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can meet a Challenge, everybody involved needs
to agree on what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do, exactly. This is called
&lt;em&gt;Setting up&lt;/em&gt;. To setup the Challenge, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to answer a
few questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Player&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt; What is the Challenge you&amp;rsquo;re trying to meet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Player&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Means&lt;/strong&gt; How are you trying to meet it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Reach&lt;/strong&gt; How much effect can the character reasonably achieve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Risk&lt;/strong&gt; What kind if risks does this manoeuver entail, even if it succeeds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is typically a (very short) conversation between player and
GM, to put everybody on the same wavelength. While both the Player
and the GM may have opinions on the matter, the Player has the last
word on some of these questions and the GM on others, as indicated above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These answers will be used to determine the &lt;a href=&#34;#setting-up-the-challenge-part-2&#34;&gt;Challenge rank&lt;/a&gt;,
the &lt;a href=&#34;#setting-up-the-challenge-part-2&#34;&gt;Attribute involved&lt;/a&gt;, and later
the &lt;a href=&#34;#outcome-of-a-challenge&#34;&gt;Outcome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Reach and Risk are on two different scales. It is
entirely possible to achieve a lot during a Challenge (meeting
and &lt;em&gt;possibly exceeding&lt;/em&gt; the Reach) while also paying a dire Cost
(meeting and &lt;em&gt;possibly exceeding&lt;/em&gt; the Risk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-chess-match&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight, during a reception at the Ambassador&amp;rsquo;s, an impromptu friendly Chess
match has begun between two well-known grandmasters. In front of a high-society
crowd of onlookers, Lady Buckingham, &lt;strong&gt;Chess Grandmistress of the Highest Society&lt;/strong&gt;
(PC) and Lord Dervon, &lt;strong&gt;Chess Grandmaster and Heir Apparent to the Prime Minister&lt;/strong&gt; (NPC)
will display their skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m opening with simple manoeuvers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Not so fast! What is your objective, here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m going to play chess?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;For fun?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;No, to win!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;So your objective is to win. How far are you willing to go for this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, it is no secret that Lord Dervon wants to sleep with you. If you wish, you could probably use that fact to drop a bomb on him during the conversation, for instance, or strategically show some décolletage, to get him distracted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not really who I am, is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Your call, entirely.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;No, I&amp;rsquo;ll play honestly. On the other hand, you&amp;rsquo;re right that this is a social opportunity, so there will be chatting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Are you trying anything special while chatting?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;No, just friendly conversation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, so what do you think we take this at a leisurly pace? We&amp;rsquo;ll first see how the first few moves go, while you&amp;rsquo;re chatting with Lord Devon, and see how things develop?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;That sounds good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Also, the worst you risk during these first few moves is probably looking – or sounding – like a fool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have the following answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective: Getting a good start on the chess game, while chatting amicably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Means: Counting on Lady Buckinghams&amp;rsquo; chess skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach: The position for the rest of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk: Looking or sounding like a fool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the GM&amp;rsquo;s decision would have been very different if the two characters hadn&amp;rsquo;t both been
Chess grandmasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if only Lady Buckingham had been a grandmaster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) Reach: As much domination as she whants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) Risk: Disappointing the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, if only Lord Devon had been a grandmaster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) Reach: Not being entirely dominated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) Risk:  ocial shame at being toyed with by a grandmaster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll keep our original setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, for this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume that Lady Buckingham has already used
all her Sleeve Cards, so she won&amp;rsquo;t be able to use them during this
Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex, &lt;strong&gt;Action Journalist&lt;/strong&gt;, had been in the attic for hourse, searching the house of the suspect
for clues, when he realized that a fire had started. He now needs to make an exit, hopefully with
some of the evidence he had managed to sort out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;So, I had a big heap of documents somewhere in the attic, which I intended to read more
in details. I&amp;rsquo;ll try and make an exit with these documents.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;You have maybe 10kg worth of papers, without any kind of bag to carry them all. That&amp;rsquo;s tricky.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;Ok, then I&amp;rsquo;ll just grab as many as I can put under my arm, and run to the exit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Alright. That sounds possible. If you succeed well enough, you&amp;rsquo;ll keep an armful of documents.
You might fail, of course, in which case you&amp;rsquo;ll lose some or all of the documents, but the main
risk is not to the documents, it&amp;rsquo;s to you. Because, well, there is a fire in the house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;Fair enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have the following answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective: Leaving the house safely with an armful of documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Means: Running to the exit as fast as possible while keeping documents under my arm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach: Alex should be able to reach the exit with the documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk: Anything that can happen in a fire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the GM agrees with Alex&amp;rsquo; plan and will resolve it all as one meet. The GM could
have decided that the scene deserve more pacing and that Alex would at first only reach the floor
below the attic. This would have decreased the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that the GM mentions &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;we don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re going to meet on your way down&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; – indeed, that&amp;rsquo;s something that will be decided &lt;em&gt;at the end of the Challenge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume that Alex doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any Sleeve Cards at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in Tokyo, today is Wednesday, so a giant monster attacks!
It is called Levinulon, it is taller than the Tokyo General Hospital,
and it is clearly here to destroy as much of the city as it can.
Fortunately, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force &lt;strong&gt;Mechanized Defenders of the City&lt;/strong&gt;
(that&amp;rsquo;s a single PC), in its non-military battle robots, is there to protect the city!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/posts/tourists-conflict-resolution/kaiju.png&#34; alt=&#34;Picture by Wikipedia User D J Shin – My Toy Museum – Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;For the moment, we&amp;rsquo;re taking position and trying to distract Levinulon from any civilian crowds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, how do you do this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;As much as possible, we&amp;rsquo;re using our remote-controntrolled drones, but if it&amp;rsquo;s not sufficient, we&amp;rsquo;re going to make as much noise as possible without endangering civilians. Maybe by throwing cars, or something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Alright. That sounds possible. For the moment, you&amp;rsquo;re not endangering yourselves overmuch. So, it looks like any risk you take will be something like attracting Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s attention a bit too much, too early, or perhaps destroying a few too many things around you. Also, if you succeed, you&amp;rsquo;ll certainly be fighting Levinulon next.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have the following answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective: Focus Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s attention on anything other than civilians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Means: Distracting Levinulon with drones or, if necessary, the mechs themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach: Affecting Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk: Little risk to the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force, but some risk to the city itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only works because the the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force is
equipped to fight Kaijus. Otherwise, the GM would certainly have
minimized the effect that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force
may reasonaby achieve (&amp;ldquo;save a few civilians&amp;rdquo;) and/or increased
the risk (&amp;ldquo;get wiped out in the attempt&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force
doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any Sleeve Cards at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;setting-up-the-challenge-part-2&#34;&gt;Setting up the Challenge, part 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everybody agrees on the nature of the Challenge,
two more questions can be answered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Player&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Attribute&lt;/strong&gt; What Attribute are you using for this purpose?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(GM&amp;rsquo;s decision) &lt;strong&gt;Rank&lt;/strong&gt; What&amp;rsquo;s the Rank of the Challenge?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Attributes are the 5 Attributes on the character sheet. If you recall, they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rock&lt;/strong&gt; (stability, authority, power, physical strength);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper&lt;/strong&gt; (knowledge, deduction, riches);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blades&lt;/strong&gt; (violence, ability to effect change);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serpent&lt;/strong&gt; (speed, survival, stealth, deception);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknown&lt;/strong&gt; (imagination, intuition, perception).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lower attribute will increase the likelihood that the risks (or worse) will be realized
while attempting to achieve the character&amp;rsquo;s goals, while a higher attribute will decrease
this likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Attribute picked must, of course, match the description of what the character is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranks are defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mythic 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legendary 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epic 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fantastic 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superb 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fair 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mediocre 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a higher Rank will increase the likelihood of either failure or that the risks will
be realized, while a lower Rank will decrease it considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-chess-match-1&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be relying on intelligence and deduction, so that&amp;rsquo;s Paper, which is good, because I have Superb (5) in Paper.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Lord Devon is your peer, so the difficulty will also be Superb (5).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-1&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving fast, which sounds like Serpent, while keeping the papers safely with me, which sounds like Rock. If it&amp;rsquo;s ok, I&amp;rsquo;ll take the highest, which is my Great (4) Rock.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sounds reasonable. As for the fire, since you react quickly, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too difficult for you, so it&amp;rsquo;s a Good (3) rank.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-1&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be relying on fast movement and misdirection, so that&amp;rsquo;s Serpents. I have Great (4) in Serpent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Given Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s size and general taste for mayhem and destruction, attracting his attention might be very difficult. So, let&amp;rsquo;s make it a Superb (4) difficulty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;drawing-cards-and-narrating-progress&#34;&gt;Drawing cards and narrating progress&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-overcoming/cardsharps.png&#34; alt=&#34;Caravaggio – The Cardsharps - Public Domain – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that everything is setup, the next step is to draw cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenge-draws-and-gm-narrates&#34;&gt;Challenge draws and GM narrates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Challenge draws as many cards as its Rank and places them,
face visible, on the table. Orientation of cards matters. This
is typically done by the GM, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a special rule, if the Challenge encounters the Excuse while
drawing, drawing stops at the card before the Excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay special attention to the cards that are reversed. They will be
used to determine the &lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt; of the Challenge. Similarly, any
card drawn by the Challenge may affect the &lt;strong&gt;Effect&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Challenge has drawn, whoever drew for these cards gets
to narrate some of the difficulties encountered by the character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-chess-match-2&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lord Devon represents a Superb (5) challenge, the GM draws 5 cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Lord Devon is obviously in no hurry (&lt;em&gt;Longevity&lt;/em&gt;). He starts slowly, cautiously
following his usual style (&lt;em&gt;Heaven &amp;amp; Hell, the usual game&lt;/em&gt;). What you may or may
not realize in time is that he has a sophisticated trap in mind (&lt;em&gt;Subterfuge&lt;/em&gt;)
against your Queen (&lt;em&gt;Living to Consume&lt;/em&gt;). At the end of this early game, the
trap will have closed and it will be &lt;em&gt;Too late for subterfuges&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-2&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the fire represents a Good (3) challenge, the GM draws 3 cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;For a while, you were busy in the attic, digging through crates of paperworks,
and nothing happened. The attic is full of, well, way too many things. You can find
Japanese artwork (&lt;em&gt;Soldier of Paper&lt;/em&gt;), old movie parapharnelia (&lt;em&gt;Lover of Unknown&lt;/em&gt;),
and tons of things piled haphazardly on top of each other (&lt;em&gt;Failures on top of failures&lt;/em&gt;).
And suddenly, as if coming from nowhere, fire (&lt;em&gt;Sudden power&lt;/em&gt;)!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the GM didn&amp;rsquo;t use the interpretation &lt;em&gt;Underestimating the enemy&lt;/em&gt;, as they couldn&amp;rsquo;t find
    a way to use this without forcing their narration on Alex. Alex&amp;rsquo; player has control
    over his character, so only that player may decide whether Alex did or did not
    underestimate the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-2&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is Superb (4), so the GM draws 4 cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, the GM decides to take things mostly literally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;By the time you arrive, Levinulon has already destroyed a large subway station
(&lt;em&gt;XI. of Triumph&lt;/em&gt;) and is tearing apart a skyscraper (&lt;em&gt;IV. of Triumph&lt;/em&gt;). Under
its footstep, you can also see the remains of what must have been a brothel
(&lt;em&gt;A truth, uncovered&lt;/em&gt;), full of naked people dead or screaming.
Levinulon simply stepped through it, tearing through as if it had
been paper (&lt;em&gt;Overlooking an obstacle&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;character-draws-and-player-narrates&#34;&gt;Character draws and Player narrates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To beat the challenge, the player will now draw cards for their
character. The challenge is beaten if the player draws cards that
beat all the cards of the Challenge. As the player draws cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the likelihood of beating the Challenge increases;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;Effect&lt;/strong&gt; of beating the Challenge increases;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt; increases, which may prompt the player to stop drawing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player may decide to not draw cards. If this happens, all Cost
is avoided, regardless of the number of reversed cards already drawn
by the Challenge. Unless the challenge had a Rank of 0, this means
that the challenge is not beaten. Also, to provide a manner for the
character to bounce back to initiative, the player draws one
Sleeve Card, to be used after this Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the player decides to draw, they take cards one by one, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Cost starts below 0, at minus the value of the Attribute involved;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before drawing a card, the player may decide to stop;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the card is the Excuse, discard it and stop drawing immediately;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the card is reversed, it increases the Cost;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the Cost is 5, this is a &lt;strong&gt;Wipe Out&lt;/strong&gt;, stop drawing immediately
(you don&amp;rsquo;t want a Wipe Out, ever);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the table has 1 (respectively 2, 3, 4, 5) cards of the same
figure (e.g. 2 Servants, or 2 Lovers, or 2 Dragons, &amp;hellip;), this
increases the Effect to 1 (respectively 2, 3, 4, 5). This includes
both the cards of the character and those of the Challenge. As
Triumphs have no figure, they do not count towards Effect;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after drawing every card, the player narrates their charater&amp;rsquo;s
effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall, the GM has drawn the following cards for Lord Devon:&lt;/p&gt;

        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s unlucky for Lady Buckingham, as this card is the strongest in
the entire deck:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-26.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Lady Buckingham simply cannot beat this hand, Lady Buckingham&amp;rsquo;s
player decides to not draw. She has lost this round,
but as she hasn&amp;rsquo;t drawn, there is no Cost for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-3&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall, the GM has drawn the following cards for the Furnace:&lt;/p&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 43&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alex is luckier than Lady Buckingham, as all these cards can be beaten.
So far, two cards are reversed. Since Alex has a Great (4) Rock, that&amp;rsquo;s
a Cost of -2 so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex starts drawing&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-44.png&#34;

                alt=&#34;Card number 44, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This card is reversed, so Cost climbs to -1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;Fire quickly spreads everywhere, it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;nightmare&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t beat any of the
cards of the Challenge, so Alex decides to continue drawing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-36.png&#34;

                alt=&#34;Card number 36, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This card is reversed, so the Cost climbs to Mediocre (0). This card is a Paper,
Paper beats Unknown, so the two Unknown cards in the Challenge&amp;rsquo;s hand
are now beaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by &lt;em&gt;paper&lt;/em&gt; and rotting timber (&lt;em&gt;Letting the world rot&lt;/em&gt;).
This is going to get even worse soon!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one more card to beat!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-10.png&#34;

                alt=&#34;Card number 10, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This card is reversed, again, so the Cost climbs to Average (1). So far, it&amp;rsquo;s a
very minor Cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;At first, I look for an easy way out, a manner of getting out
of there without going through the fire, but no, that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;futile&lt;/em&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;ll need to go through the fire to get out of here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This card is a Triumph, so it beats all the cards of
the Challenge. At this stage, the Challenge is won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at all the cards on the table:&lt;/p&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 10&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, there are no pairs, so Alex currently has an Effect of Mediocre (1). Most likely,
that means that he&amp;rsquo;ll only have managed to grab a few documents on the way out.
Alex decides to keep drawing, in order to try and increase his Effect, at the
risk of increasing the Cost.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-22.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-22.png&#34;

                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 22, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once again a Triumph, but still no pairs, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t increase the Effect.
On the upside, the card is upright, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t increase the Cost,
either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;Fortunately, as an &lt;strong&gt;Action Journalist&lt;/strong&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;always ready&lt;/em&gt; for action.
I bravely step through the fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex continues.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One more Triumph, but still no pairs, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t increase the Effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;As I walk through the furnace, covering my face as well as I can to avoid
breathing toxic fumes, I hear a &lt;em&gt;big bang&lt;/em&gt; somewhere, but I won&amp;rsquo;t let this distract me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex continues.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-58.png&#34;

                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 58, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ahah, that&amp;rsquo;s a second Builder! That gives Alex one pair. He decides
to stop drawing here, with a Cost of Mediocre (1) and an Effect of Fair (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;In a final display of my trademarked &lt;strong&gt;Action Journalist&lt;/strong&gt; sprinting skill,
I manage to leave the furnace. I end up in the street&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s see in which state.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-3&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall, Levinulon drew:&lt;/p&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 14&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force is Great (4) in Serpents, so starts with a Cost of -4.
Since one card is already reversed, that&amp;rsquo;s now -3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is greater. Also, Cost increases to -2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;For the moment, it looks like Levinulon hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen us at all, or our drones (&lt;em&gt;Where is Waldo?&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s remains greater. Also, Cost increases to -1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s actually quite humbling. Even in our mechs, we feel like paper dolls in front of this giant (&lt;em&gt;Diminished&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is still greater. Costs remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;To add to the insult, it really looks like Levinulon is having too much &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; destroying these buildings and killing all these people to pay attention to us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is still greater. Cost increases to Mediocre (0).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Also, the very ground is shaking whenever Levinulon takes a step (&lt;em&gt;Unreliable foundations&lt;/em&gt;). Our mechs are built for mobility, which makes us relatively frail. We keep losing our balance and stumbling around as the ground shakes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is still greater. Cost increases to Average (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;We must have turned around Levinulon five or six times, making as much noise as possible, without succeeding at catching his attention (&lt;em&gt;Senseless cycle&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-21.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-21.png&#34;

                alt=&#34;Card number 21, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus is finally beaten! Cost increases to Fair (2). There are two Soldiers on the table, so the Effect
is currently Fair (2). The GM informs the player that the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force itself is now at some risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Finally, in a very risky move, our Pigeon-Class Mech takes flight above
Levinulon (&lt;em&gt;Taking Flight&lt;/em&gt;) and Levinulon looks at it. I think we caught its attention!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force prioritizes saving citizens to its own survival, the player would like
an Effect of Good (3). For this purpose, the player would need a third Soldier. The player draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-54.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-54.png&#34;

                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 54, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cost increases to Good (3), with an Effect still at Fair (2). The GM informs the player that any further reversed card
will start hurting the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Yes, Levinulon looks away from the latest skyscraper
it was destroying (&lt;em&gt;Farewell to the mighty&lt;/em&gt;) and finally focuses upon us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bravely, Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-72.png&#34;

                alt=&#34;Card number 72, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This card alters neither the Cost nor the Effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time for the mechs to show their &lt;em&gt;Polyvalence&lt;/em&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re going to try and
surround him, to ensure that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a single target, and make as much noise as possible to ensure
that he keeps focusing on us!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without fear, Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force draws again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-32.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-32.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;

                alt=&#34;Card number 32, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a second Ruler, so a second pair. This does not influence the Effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Incoming message from the Command Center (&lt;em&gt;Ruler&lt;/em&gt;): &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t get so close,
it can destroy you all easily!&amp;lsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force decides to stop before luck runs out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Tokyo Defense Force has acheived a Fair (2) Effect at a Good (3) Cost.
It could have been worse (the rules are design to make Cost easier to
accumulate than Effect). The player will get a second opportunity to
interpret this result in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;outcome-of-a-challenge&#34;&gt;Outcome of a Challenge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the cards are drawn, the only thing that remains to do is
to narrate the outcome. Typically, most of what happened during
the Challenge has already been narrated, but now is time to conclude
it as a Success or Failure, and to account for Cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule is that the Player is entirely in charge of
narrating the outcome, as long as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact another
player&amp;rsquo;s character – if this happens, you need the agreement
of that other player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when you narrate Effect and
Cost, the GM is in charge of making sure that the description
is roughly proportionate to the Effect and Cost as drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;determining-and-narrating-failure&#34;&gt;Determining and narrating Failure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A character has Failed if at least one card of the Challenge was
not beaten or if the player decided to not draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means, in particular, that a character can simply never fail
a Challenge with a rank of Mediocre (0).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your character has failed, pick some of the cards on the table
and use them to narrate what has happened. If it sounds interesting,
the GM may ask you to write down your Failure as an Aspect, which may
be used later to elaborate on the consequences of this Failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-chess-match-4&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady Buckingham&amp;rsquo;s player chooses to interpret the following cards
picked by Lord Devon:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure
    class=&#34;yoric-hand &#34;&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 78&#34;
        /&gt;
    
        
        
        
        &lt;img
            src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-39.png&#34;
            data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-39.png&#34;

            alt=&#34;Card number 39&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Buckingham: &amp;ldquo;Lord Devon has managed to trick me.
I should realized that he was using the Calrissian gambit, but unfortunately,
I fell for it. Now, my only way out of his trap is forward. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to
play aggressively from now on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Can you write down an Aspect?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player writes &lt;strong&gt;Tricked by Lord Devon&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Lord Devon and Lady Buckingham will remember what has just happened –
there will be consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as Lady Buckingham conceded the Challenge, she gets to draw one Sleeve Card&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-47.png&#34;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use it for the mid-game of this match, or
anytime after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;determining-and-narrating-success&#34;&gt;Determining and narrating Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If each card drawn by the Challenge is beaten by at least one card
drawn by the player, the Challenge ends in a Success for the
character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-overcoming/Richmond_newsboy_announcing_the_rebel_success.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Richmond newsboy announcing the rebel success!!! – Illus. in: Harper&#39;s Weekly, 1862. – Public Domain – Source: Library of Congress&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to look at the Reach and Effect to determine just how much
the character has managed to achieve. As a general idea, if the
Effect is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great (5) – The character has achieved the best possible result, regardless
of the Reach established before drawing cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good (4) – The character has exceeded the Reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fair (3) – The character has almost achieved the Reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average (2) – The character has roughly achieved half of their Reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mediocre (1) – It&amp;rsquo;s a nominal success, but frankly, nothing was achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player should now pick a few of the cards (typically,
the pair/triple/&amp;hellip; if there is any) and use it to narrate
the Effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Effect and Cost do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cancel out each other,
so you may end up with a Great Effect and an equally
Great Cost for the same Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, if it sounds interesting,
the GM may ask you to write down your Success as an Aspect, which may
be used later to elaborate on the consequences of this Success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-4&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex has succeeded at escaping the Furnace with the following pair:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure
    class=&#34;yoric-hand &#34;&gt;
    
        
        
        
        &lt;img
            src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-36.png&#34;
            data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-36.png&#34;
            data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
            
                
                
                    class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-hand-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                    alt=&#34;Card number 36, reversed&#34;
                
                
            
            alt=&#34;Card number 36&#34;
        /&gt;
    
        
        
        
        &lt;img
            src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-58.png&#34;
            data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-58.png&#34;
            data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
            
                
                    class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-hand-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                    alt=&#34;Card number 58, upright&#34;
                
                
                
            
            alt=&#34;Card number 58&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s an Average (2) Effect, which means that he&amp;rsquo;s achieved roughly
half of what he was attempting to do. This could mean for instance
that Alex hasn&amp;rsquo;t reached the exit yet, or that Alex has lost roughly
half of the documents, or that Alex has only grabbed a handful of
documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;Ok, that&amp;rsquo;s not ideal, but it&amp;rsquo;s still better than nothing.
So, with my great investigation skills, I had actually managed
to find hundreds and hundreds of documents, which I was in the
process of sorting into boxes. When I realized that the house
was on fire, I started grabbing two boxes, one under each arm,
but when I reached the ladder, I figured that I could couldn&amp;rsquo;t
both get these papers down the ladder and save my skin. I decided
that my skin was more important than my investigation, so
I stuffed what I could in my pockets and ran the rest of the
way to the exit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Alex has slightly changed the initial description of
his actions now that he knows the result of the cards. As long
as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the outcome, this is entirely acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Could you write this down as an Aspect?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player writes down &lt;strong&gt;Most of the evidence was destroyed, but a few wads of paper survived.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-best-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace (best possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Alex had succeeded with a Superb (5) Effect, he would have made
it out of the furnace with all the important papers. The furnace
might accidentally even have helped him reveal hidden proofs or
clues – possibly a dead body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-4&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force had, with difficulty, succeeded
with a Fair (2) Effect, with the following pairs:&lt;/p&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 32&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Reach was to affect Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s focus. Since an Effect
of Fair (2) suggests that the Reach is halfway met, this can
translate to the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force having succeeded,
but not before Levinulon has had the time to kill a large number
of civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;For me, &lt;em&gt;Farewell to the Mighty&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The rule is the same for all&lt;/em&gt;
indicate that Levinulon has destroyed a very important building. Say
the Bank of Japan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;The Reach was about civilians.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Oh, right. Well, while we
were still trying to attrack Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s attention, it stepped
on the building, before they had time to evacuate. There will
be hundreds of casualties, including the President of the Bank
of Japan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s in addition to the subway station, the brothel, etc.?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Yeah. Lots of damage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;You could have done a little less, but it sounds fair. What about
an Aspect?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player writes down an Aspect &lt;strong&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force couldn&amp;rsquo;t
save the Bank of Japan.&lt;/strong&gt; Undoubtedly, there will be consequences at some
point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-best-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack (best possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force had succeeded with a Superb (5) Effect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in that case, it would immediately have attracted the attention of Levinulon.
Moreover, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force would certainly have found a way to
neutralize Levinulon as a threat, possibly by managing to lead it out of Tokyo,
or to move the fight underwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-chess-match-best-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match (best possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if Lady Buckingham had succeeded with a Superb (5) Effect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in that case, she would have clearly dominated the early game – possibly
with an early checkmate, if the player decided. Also, since such a large
Effect gives the player the ability to considerably exceed the Reach, she
would have managed to further whatever objective she had for this evening.
Perhaps, during the idle chat, she could have managed to slip information
meant to be heard by the right persons, starting the appropriate
high-society rumor, or she could have gotten Lord Devon to accidentally
divulge a secret of interest to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;determining-and-narrating-cost&#34;&gt;Determining and narrating Cost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you succeeded or failed, it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at the Risk
and Cost to determine just how much the character has suffered from this
Challenge. As a general idea, if the Cost is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great (5) – The worst thing that could happen to the characters in the context
has happened, regardless of what Risk was established before drawing the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good (4) – The cost exceeds the Risk established before drawing
the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fair (3) – The cost is not quite as bad as the Risk established before drawing the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average (2) – The cost is roughly half of the Risk established before drawing the cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mediocre (1) – The cost is minor and temporary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that players can decide to stop their draw whenever they want, so Costs
of Good or Great will be extremely rare, and even Costs of Fair will be uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-chess-match-5&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady Buckingham conceded the Challenge without drawing cards, so
she incurs no Cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-chess-match-worst-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Chess match (worst possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Lady Buckingham had suffered a Great (5) cost, regardless of winning
or losing, she would somehow have passed for a fool in front of a
crowd of her peers. The player would have narrative control to decide
exactly how this would have happened, and whether Lady Buckingham is
responsible or simply a victim of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, people in the crowd could have started gossiping about
her highly improper – and possibly entirely imaginary – flirt with
Lord Sussex, or her pregnancy. Or could have received a
message that a certain Scotland Yard detective was waiting for her
in the antechamber, along with a few bobbies dispatched to arrest
her. Or she could have been drunk and making improper jokes while
playing chess, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, none of this happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-5&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, Alex suffers a Cost of 1, which is barely worth
mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player looks at one of the reversed cards&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m getting out of this fire alive, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be having nightmares
for nights to come!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sounds about fair. Could you write down this as a temporary Aspect
for me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex writes down &lt;strong&gt;Nightmares on Fire&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-escaping-the-furnace-worst-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Escaping the Furnace (worst possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Alex had suffered a Cost of 5, he would not have died in the furnace,
as his draw was successful. However, he might have collapsed in the street,
poisoned by the toxic fumes, and spent the next two years in an hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, he could have made it out of the fire only to be shot by whoever
had started this fire. Or only to receive a phone call from his editor
informing him that he was let go for unspecified reasons. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the player gets to narrate a worst case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-5&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has suffered from a Good (3) Cost, with
the following reversed cards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Risk was: &amp;ldquo;Little risk to the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force, but some risk to the city itself.&amp;rdquo; –
as mentioned by the GM, with a Good (3) Cost, the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force
actually suffers from this Cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force: &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;Unreliable Foundations&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Farewell to the Mighty&lt;/em&gt;,
so that sounds like buildings collapsing. We&amp;rsquo;ve already covered some of that. There has been
considerable destruction, not just the Bank of Japan. I also see &lt;em&gt;Overlooking an
Obstacle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diminished&lt;/em&gt; – that sounds like one of my drivers was hiding behind one of the
buildings that was destroyed, and didn&amp;rsquo;t get out in time. So one of the mechs is severely
damaged, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if he&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make it for the rest of the event.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Can you write me down an Aspect?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player writes down &lt;strong&gt;One severely damaged mech&lt;/strong&gt;. This will undoubtedly serve later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack-worst-possible-case-variant&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju attack (worst possible case variant)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a Great (5) Cost, the Challenge could have covered a much longer period of time,
with the mechs desperately attempting to attract the attention of Levinulo before he
could destroy too much of Tokyo. Since the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force has succeeded,
a large part of Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s population would have had time to escape, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, much of the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force would have been damaged or destroyed
in the process, rendering the entire force unusable against Levinulon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-happens-when-a-npc-attempts-to-do-something&#34;&gt;What happens when a NPC attempts to do something?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you have seen, the rules cover only the case of a PC attempting an action.
This is by design: while it is often fun for players to draw cards, take risks
or play it safe, and see what happens to their characters, the GM is expected
to be impartial and to handle the entire world, which makes notions such as
risks and effects redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if a NPC attempts an action on a non-consenting PC, in N-Dimensional
Tourists, this will simply be handled as a PC Challenging the NPC&amp;rsquo;s action.
The rules are identical and the PC is till the one meeting the Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a NPC attempts to do something on another NPC, rules are neither particularly
necessary nor particularly interesting. The GM is encouraged to either decide the
results, possibly drawing a card for inspiration, or ask one of the players to
draw a card and decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sometimes-it-s-not-a-challenge&#34;&gt;Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s not a Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting a Challenge in N-Dimensional Tourist is not exactly the same process
as resolving an action in most Role-Playing Games. For one thing, it involves
Risks. Also, high levels of Cost or Effect can have a profound impact on the
story itself. Also, setting up a Conflict, then drawing and interpreting an
unbounded number of cards simply takes more time and effort of imagination
than rolling a die and getting a quick answer. That&amp;rsquo;s probably not something
you want to happen whenever a character is opening a door, climbing stairs or
having lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a GM, whenever a character is doing something, before setting up a
Challenge, you need to decide whether this action actually deserves a
Challenge. As a general guideline, if the action involves no interesting
reasonable consequences (Risk or Reach), don&amp;rsquo;t make it a Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;risks-costs-vs-reach-effect&#34;&gt;Risks/Costs vs. Reach/Effect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between the Reach and the Risk and
setup a Challenge in such a manner that a high Cost will not contradict a high
Effect. If you encounter such a case, the simplest solution is to assume:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it&amp;rsquo;s within the control of the character, it&amp;rsquo;s a Reach/Effect;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if it&amp;rsquo;s without the control of the character, it&amp;rsquo;s a Risk/Cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the example of the Chess Match, Lady Buckingham can, to
some extent, control what happens on the chessboard and in the conversation
between her and Lord Devon, but not what gossip may be circulating in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by no means the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way of designing Risk vs. Reach or
Cost vs. Effect, but in our experience, it works when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weapons-armors-and-superpowers&#34;&gt;Weapons, armors and superpowers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-conflict-resolution/party.png&#34; alt=&#34;Photo by Wikipedia user William Tung – Cosplay of DC Comics characters at San Diego Comic Con 2015. – Licensed under CC-BY-SA 2.0 – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many games, weapons, armors, superpowers and other manners of affecting
the universe have dedicated rules. In N-Dimensional Tourists, they are typically
considered instances of Aspects, either temporary or permanent. As such, they
provide narrative authorization for characters to accomplish things that they would
not have been able to accomplish otherwise, and they can be affected by
Sleeve Cards, but they have no special rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the Kaiju Attack, the mechs are part of &lt;strong&gt;Mechanized Defenders of the City&lt;/strong&gt;.
As such, they authorize the Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force to go head-to-head against
Levinulon. They do not otherwise affect the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some equipment is absolutely central to your character, you may make it a Specialty,
and customize the rule. In effect, this equipment will become part of your character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wounds-traumas-and-social-consequences&#34;&gt;Wounds, Traumas and Social Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many games have rules to represent the health of a character. In N-Dimensional Tourists,
there are no such rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your character is doing something particularly risky (as established by the Risk)
or takes too many chances while doing it (as established by the Cost), they may be
wounded, or traumatized, or shunned out of polite society, or sentenced to jail,
or any other kind of heavy consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all (negative) Aspects. Depending on the gravity of the Aspect, it may be
simple to get rid of it, harder, or even entirely impossible. Differences between
such aspects exists entirely in-story and not covered by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;death&#34;&gt;Death&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as there are no specific rules for health, there are no rules for Death. While
the threat of Death can make for an interesting story, we feel that Death itself is
generally not interesting enough that it deserves special rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a character has to die because it makes sense in the story, then let it happen.
Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because the character was Wiped Out in a Challenge that involved a
clear risk of Death. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because of a heroic sacrifice, or something that
had been decided by the player for some time. In either case, we believe that
Death is nothing that requires special rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, exceptions. You may be playing in a setting which allows the
game to continue past Death, in which case Death becomes simply part of the story,
possibly a simple Aspect. If you are playing in such a setting, you may want to come
up with rules – or at least agreements – on how to handle Death, Afterlife,
Resurrection, Ghosts, Undead and the like. If so, your agreement will be highly
specific to your setting.&lt;/p&gt;
