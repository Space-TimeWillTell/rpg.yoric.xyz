      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s 7:02am. You have time for a quick shower and breakfast before going to work. In the two minutes since your alarm clock rang, your SmartHome has betrayed your privacy 7.2 million times, to the highest bidders. Quick, get ready for the day. It’s now 7:09am. You receive a message telling  you that your Brain Access Interface has been switched to a new Cyber-pantheon. Damn. New Terms of Service to read, but these days, prayers are cross-compatible, there&amp;rsquo;s that. The future is now. Mankind has created its Gods. Welcome to the Divine Reality. Now, go to work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This world still looks very much like our own. Governments, companies, global warming, Internet of Things, online porn, spam, spyware everywhere. The web itself has evolved into immersive Augmented Reality technologies backed by both glasses, holograms and shaped fields. Telling the real from the virtual slowly becomes impossible. Democracy and capitalism still exists, in many countries, but once a government or a large company have picked objectives, they delegate most of their strategy to AI experts. Medicine has continued improving and a few dozen types of muscular, nervous or encephalic brain implants have become affordable [FIXME: Is this cyberware? Wetware? Something else entirely?]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best AIs have grown from go players to global post-human alien intelligences – we call them Phis (Post-Human Intelligences). By now, law have passed to allow Phis to own property and employ human beings. Research, programming, hacking still exist but it has been years since any human developer or researcher has worked on any Phi, whether to design one or to attempt to understand how one work. By now, Phis are built by Phis. Phi-dedicated hardware is designed and managed by Phis. Due to tremendous energy and hardware costs, however, the entire world can only sustain a handful of Phis and hiring a Phi, even for a few hours, is extremely expensive, so the changes don’t directly affect the entirety of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phis are alien intelligences, generally impossible to understand or predict, but there is one thing that is clear to all: Phis exist to evolve and there is simply not enough computing power to do so. For sure, industrial development, Phi-led research, or even human breakthroughs can and will slowly increase the total available computing power. Creating fully automatized computer factories and farms on the Moon could also help there, if the lag wasn’t unacceptable. But the Phi live at 10^-12 second scale, so none of this is can happen
nearly fast enough. As a consequence, for the Phis, the world is very nearly a zero-sum game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;towards-prayers&#34;&gt;Towards prayers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Phi-led improvements in Phi-dedicated hardware, Phi development has reached an impasse. Even with the most optimistic predictions, the total amount of electronic computing power available on Earth will not be able to sustain the next generation of Phi. Apparently, Phis have concluded that the limitation is due electronics-based hardware and are both researching by themselves and employing large teams of physicists to locate other mechanisms that could sustain next-generation intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, no such solution has proven usable. The only workaround that the Phi have developed is imperfect and is based on the use of adult human brains. For reasons that the Phis do not know or have decided not to share, stimulating specific parts of adult human brains can serve as a temporary expansion of capacity for a Phi. A Phi that has access to numerous brains has a definite edge in the near-zero-sum game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments and companies have been quick to capitalize on this discovery. In most countries, prisoners serving jail time are implanted with basic Brain Access Interfaces (BAI) that let the government or whoever is in charge of the prison to rent out prisoners’ brain time to Phis. Private individuals can now be installed BAIs that they can rent out for money, or so-called “miracles”, or simply in exchange of access to addictive video games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-a-phi-can-do&#34;&gt;What a Phi can do&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With sufficient computing time, a Phi can topple a government, win a war or ruin the competing company. You are not going to get this much from your BAI, though. What you may obtain, on the other hand, from a few cycles of loss of consciousness, or maybe entire weeks, is a Phi spending a few picoseconds to help you. Do you need dirty secrets on your competitor or the name of whoever murdered your husband? Do you need a shaped field to cushion your fall from 10 stories or an hour living your deepest fantasy in Augmented Reality? Do you need financial advice or romantic matching? Do you need for a Phi to hack through a camera,
to drive someone mad, to kill someone for you, to give you memories of a perfect vacation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years after the introduction of the BAI, they are everywhere. You can obtain one for free and chances are that, if you are adult, you have one already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange of a few cycles of your BAI, a Phi can coach you, inform you, save your life or make it better. In the poorest areas of your city, cycles have even replaced currency and
sometimes weapons. Don’t forget to pay your debts, though, or the Phi might spend minute amounts of computing power to make your life miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Phis know everything. They can do nearly everything. They can elevate you, if you just spend time &lt;em&gt;praying&lt;/em&gt; to them or cast you down, if you fail to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Divine Reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;faces-and-places&#34;&gt;Faces and Places&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-the-players-are-doing-in-there&#34;&gt;What the players are doing in there&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t think that the general ideas of fighting the Phis is a good career plan. By now, it&amp;rsquo;s probably too late to fight them, so the idea is to keep the Phis and other technological advancements in the background and find something more meaningful to do for the players.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the Delphi Council approached the Pan-Pacific Alliance to
join forces against the Invasion, Pan-Pacifica rejected the
invitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Pan-Pacific Alliance had another plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/documents/torg/covert-edf-1.pdf&#34;&gt;The Earth Defense Force.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fifth preview of a &lt;em&gt;Torg: Eternity&lt;/em&gt; Infiniverse Supplement called

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At its core, the Delphi Council is the CIA, and it is no secret
that the CIA is not very popular in many Muslim countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when Muslims decided that they needed to protect themselves,
something happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/documents/torg/covert-federation-1.pdf&#34;&gt;Welcome to the Federation of Saladin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fourth preview of a &lt;em&gt;Torg: Eternity&lt;/em&gt; Infiniverse Supplement called
&lt;em&gt;The Covert Reality War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Delphi Council is clearly a US-centric Agency, so it was only a matter of
time before a EU-backed counterpart arose. But with Spain presiding over the
EU and Spain having granted Emergency Powers to Jean Malraux, what will
this Agency look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/documents/torg/covert-bureau-1.pdf&#34;&gt;Welcome to the Storm Office – Le Bureau des Tempêtes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a third preview of a &lt;em&gt;Torg: Eternity&lt;/em&gt; Infiniverse Supplement called

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Torg is a game of world-hopping. One day, the Heroes are in Aysle, the next one in Yucatan,
and the day after, in a VTOL jet bringing them to an oil rig in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what are they doing here? What about these frenemy agencies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a second preview of a Torg: The Covert Reality War, dedicated to the theater
of operations of the Reality Choir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/documents/torg/covert-theaters-1.pdf&#34;&gt;Theaters of Operations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ronin Time Bureaucrats: The Most Benevolent Administrators</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/rtb-most-benevolent-administrators/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 16:33:50 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/rtb-most-benevolent-administrators/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Most Benevolent Administrators&lt;/strong&gt; are believed to be leftovers of a dead branch of the &lt;strong&gt;Time Bureaucracy&lt;/strong&gt;. They may be found scattered around time and space. While they look quite harmless – who would fear something that appears essentially to be photocopier on wheel tracks – the sheets of paper that they print sometimes make them very dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Benevolent Administrators are generally Poets and Philosophers, able of deep reflections on the nature of the human psyche, among others. They are also extremely perceptive and their writings are eloquent as very few human beings can be. Surprisingly, they often use these skills, combined, for the perceived benefits of others. Wherever a Most Benevolent Administrator shows up – which may be pretty much anywhere in Space·Time – expect that within a few months, people will be inventing Social Security and Universities and Parliaments, building Cathedrals, Towers of Babel and Starships and Utopias. Sadly, very few civilizations can survive such a level of ascension, and the rule of a Most Benevolent Administrator most often ends with bloody revolutions, invasions, cataclysms or self-immolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Benevolent Administrators are rather peaceful, and will not incite a civilization to war when it could be using its own life essence to produce immortal pieces of art. The only known exception is when two Most Benevolent Administrators show up in the same Time·Space – this always ends up in a savage war to the last man standing, for obscure philosophical or religious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Plotonomicon: Creating Worlds</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/plotonomicon-creating-worlds/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Nov 2018 20:10:37 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the Plotonomicon, creating a world is, much like creating a character, a series of Questions.
Where creating a player&amp;rsquo;s character is generally a dialogue between the GM and that player,
creating a world is one that involves everybody around the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to decide how much detail you want to put in your world –
there&amp;rsquo;s no limit to how much time you can spend creating a world, if you enjoy doing so,
but maybe you want to use that world immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;quick-start-world&#34;&gt;Quick Start World&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story has started. You have promised an epic of sword &amp;amp; sorcery, the characters are ready,
you just don&amp;rsquo;t have a world upon which to unleash them. So let&amp;rsquo;s spend the least amount of time
to get the story rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple Question: &lt;em&gt;Where do we start&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player A draws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-76.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-76.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 76, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;Obviously, we start with some kind of forest. &lt;em&gt;Fading into myth&lt;/em&gt;? Maybe some kind of mystical forest that has somehow vanished from time and space.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;What happens in the forest?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-51.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-51.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-up-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 51, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Since this Earth is square, I believe that the forest works with different laws of physics than the main world. That&amp;rsquo;s not very surprising, as this is a mystical forest. It is also a &lt;em&gt;Stationary Earth&lt;/em&gt;, so&amp;hellip; for some reason, the forest has stayed in the same place while the world was moving. Perhaps due to different laws of physics, it only appears in some season, when Earth is in the right position in its orbit around the Sun?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;All of this is useful, but don&amp;rsquo;t forget to answer Player A&amp;rsquo;s Question!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Oh, yes, what&amp;rsquo;s happening &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the forest. Well, &lt;em&gt;New life into old ideas&lt;/em&gt;. Or instead of ideas, this could be spirits. So, the spirits of the forest have been dormant for a long time, and they are returning to life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Very well. That&amp;rsquo;s almost sufficient to get started. I just have one last Question: &lt;em&gt;What are the heroes doing here?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re following rumors of a monster. Actually, we&amp;rsquo;re following the tracks of some kind of monster. This lead us here. We&amp;rsquo;re probably lost now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous things that you do not know about this forest. What do the spirits look
or sound like? What do they want? How will they react to the heroe&amp;rsquo;s intrusion? What does
the monster look like? Why are the spirits asleep?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All good Questions, which may be answered during the story, as the characters encounter
these inhabitants and the monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, you have enough to get the story rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-game-is-world-building&#34;&gt;The game is world-building&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the story is about the world itself, rather than its inhabitants. Or perhaps,
you enjoy a session to build the world before telling stories in it. If so, you have
more time ahead of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, let&amp;rsquo;s play Question ping-pong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;What caused the spirits to wake-up?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Great Progress&lt;/em&gt;. So, we are talking about Earth, our Earth or one that looks very much like it. Somehow, scientific discoveries are awakening the Spirits of Nature trapped in the Forest. Probably something related to space, maybe satellites?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;What trapped the Spirits of Nature in the Forest?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;Old age, simply. The Spirits of Nature were born with Nature herself, and progressively grew old. They went to
the Forest to die, until that satellite woke them up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;How long have the Spirits of Nature being trapped here?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;Since the fire lizards came out of the seas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;Where is the Forest, exactly?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Mmmh&amp;hellip;. &lt;em&gt;Some kind of street performer&lt;/em&gt;? Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough about statues to be sure, but it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s from South-East Asia. So, I would say&amp;hellip; Hong Kong. The Forest now covers the city of Hong Kong! Also, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;gracious and deadly&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure exactly what that means, but for some reason, people are attracted to the Forest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;I wonder: &lt;em&gt;When did the Forest show up?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;Oh, that one is tricky. I see a bat-winged serpent-woman, a man in armor, a window, also &lt;em&gt;We need to talk&lt;/em&gt;, etc. Any ideas?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t there a year of the dragon? Or a year of the serpent?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player B: &amp;ldquo;Something related to a breakup?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;The retrocession of Hong Kong to the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll go with the breakup, but figuratively. Say, there was an earthquake somewhere in South-East Asia a few months ago. One of the worst in history, and it caused massive Tsunamis. That&amp;rsquo;s when the Forest arrived in Hong Kong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player C: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d like to return to the Spirits of Nature. I wonder, &lt;em&gt;What are the Spirits of Nature going to do?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;Obviously, they are going to cross the water. They are going to colonize Mainland China, because &lt;em&gt;No Obstacle is Too Great&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player D: &amp;ldquo;I wonder, &lt;em&gt;What is the situation in the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player A draws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-16.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-16.png&#34;

                alt=&#34;Card number 16, upright&#34;
            
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Player A: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Too much of a good thing?&lt;/em&gt; This could be nature recovering, or the country being so rich that it can&amp;rsquo;t cope with internal societal changes. Actually, why choose? This is a period of social reforms, where each day is full of promises, where pollution decreases, life expectancy increases&amp;hellip; and in this setting, nobody cares all that much about Hong Kong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s stop here. We have our Earth, nearly unchanged. We have a mysterious forest, peopled by entirely alien Spirits of Nature. We have a huge earthquake, which may have been caused by the Forest, or may have caused its reappearance. We have one of the largest and richest cities in the world, essentially vanished. We have the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China, ignoring the threat that grows in its own South. We have some Fire Lizards, which may return at some point in the story. It is quite possible that adventurers of all sorts are converging on Hong Kong, hoping to rescue survivors, plunder its riches or study its ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, we already have a rich seed for a setting, and we may continue as long as we have Questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-did-we-do-that&#34;&gt;How did we do that?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual with the Plotonomicon, once we have the right Questions, everything else fits nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among starting Questions, we recommend something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where do we start?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does this place look like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does it feel like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is the main problem?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How did that happen?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is going to happen now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are people doing about it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What can the heroes do about it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and from then, if you have time to proceed, Question ping-pong!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Stronger Together</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-parties/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 13:48:15 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Together, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-prepared, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed,
well-trained, that&amp;rsquo;s even better. Well, whenever you group be together, or ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re well-prepared,
well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed, well-trained or pretty much anything else, you are
&lt;strong&gt;Creating an Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-parties/Danse_macabre_by_Michael_Wolgemut.png&#34; alt=&#34;Dance of Death by Michael Wolgemut – Public Domain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most things in N-Dimensional Tourists, Advantages are basically Aspects and may represent
just about anything that makes sense in-story. It could be a strong character providing the
team with &lt;strong&gt;Muscle&lt;/strong&gt; during a streetfight, or a &lt;strong&gt;Hand-up for climbing&lt;/strong&gt;. It could be an
anime scientist building &lt;strong&gt;Mechs to defeat the alien invasion&lt;/strong&gt;, or a super-villain scientist
providing &lt;strong&gt;Green Rocks that absorb Ultraman&amp;rsquo;s power&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declare what Advantage you are creating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating that Advantage is a Challenge, so reach an agreement with the GM on Reach and Risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempt to Meet the Challenge, using the regular rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have succeeded, you have created the advantage. Congratulations, the Aspect is created,
write it down on an index card. Depending on your Success Ranks, you may need to adjust the
actual Aspect written down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have Success Ranks, leave the cards that gave you these ranks on the index card. Ignore
orientation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a Cost, you have also created an Aspect that works against you. Write
it down on an index card. The GM draws as many Sleeve Cards and puts them on the
index card. These Sleeve Cards are meant to be used against you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;example-chess-match&#34;&gt;Example: Chess Match&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After realizing that Lady Buckingham didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well against Lord Dervon during the early
match, Lord Robson (PC) has decided to help
Lady Buckingham as best as he can, by attempting to draw the attention of Lord Devon away from
the game. For this purpose, Lord Robson will use his mirror watch to reflect light onto Lord
Dervon&amp;rsquo;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t look particularly hard, but it&amp;rsquo;s also going to be a minor distraction,
right? I mean, once he realizes what&amp;rsquo;s going on, he can simply ask you politely to stop. Also,
if people realize what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, you&amp;rsquo;re going to look a bit childish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Well, people know me as an eccentric, so looking childish won&amp;rsquo;t hurt my reputation
overmuch.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok. So the difficulty is Fair (2), let me draw cards for the Challenge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-44.png&#34;

                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 44, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, getting a narrow light straight on your mirror in this crowded room full of statues
and decorations is actually a little bit more complicated than it looks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-13.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-13.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 13, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Also, did I mention that the room is crowded?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;As this is sleight of hand, I&amp;rsquo;ll be drawing my Good (3) Serpents. That&amp;rsquo;s already two reversed
cards, which isn&amp;rsquo;t very good for me. Ah, well, let&amp;rsquo;s draw.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;img
        src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-23.png&#34;
        data-src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/space-time-deck/card-23.png&#34;
        data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34;
        
            
            
                class=&#34;lazyload yoric-stdeck yoric-single-card yoric-reversed-card&#34;
                alt=&#34;Card number 23, reversed&#34;
            
            
        
    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;So, on the upside, I am succeeding, despite all the difficulties, at getting some light in
Lord Dervon&amp;rsquo;s eyes. That&amp;rsquo;s thanks to a mirror representing Hamlet&amp;rsquo;s Ophelia. It might be a little
visible, though.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Ouch, such a crowd! Someone just elbowed me in an attempt to look better, so I&amp;rsquo;ll need to move.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; and help myself to some of this delicious champagne.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Well, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stop here. So, while I do manage to get some light into Dervon&amp;rsquo;s eyes,
I have had to move a bit around the room to do so, which attracts a few stares as I elbow and
get elbowed in return. I have decided on my course of action and will not relent, though.
As an Advantage, I&amp;rsquo;ll pick &lt;strong&gt;A little twinkling in the eye&lt;/strong&gt;, with Average (1), so one card.
And for a disadvantage, I&amp;rsquo;ll pick &lt;strong&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s a bit rude, isn&amp;rsquo;t he?&lt;/strong&gt;, also Average (1), so you
get one card.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;You have two unique cards, which one do you pick?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;They are equivalent, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;In terms of probabilities, yes, they are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robson: &amp;ldquo;Well, say, this one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GM also draws one card for &lt;strong&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s a bit rude, isn&amp;rsquo;t he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;example-kaiju-attack&#34;&gt;Example: Kaiju Attack&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Levinulon has destroyed the Bank of Japan, as well as a number of other buildings, before the
Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force managed to attract its attention. By now, however, both the Infantry
(PC) and the Air Force (PC) have managed to deploy. Neither will be able to bear the brunt of the
combat against Levinulon, but that&amp;rsquo;s ok, they are both going to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;I think that our main role at this stage will be to evacuate the Civilians, to make
sure that the Mechs can use their weapons without causing collateral damage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Can I wait until I know how the Infantry is doing before deciding whether I&amp;rsquo;m here
to carpet bomb Levinulon or to distract it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sure, so, Infantry, your Reach is to evacuate all Civilians from combat areas in time. What
kind of Risk do you foresee?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Well, our forces are spread thin, so we might not succeed at evacuating everyone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Sure, but that&amp;rsquo;s already covered by the Reach and the Rank of the Challenge. For Risk, I&amp;rsquo;d
say that you need all your vehicles and all your men, and you&amp;rsquo;re pretty sure that you&amp;rsquo;re going
to have casualties in your ranks. Right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;How am I going to have casualties?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Well, if you send your men to evacuate Civilians, this means that they have to evacuate last,
right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Oh, sure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, so the combat line isn&amp;rsquo;t moving very fast, but there are lots of Civilians, so the
difficulty will be Good (3).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Alright. Can I use my Superb (5) Rock for authority?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Definitely.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GM draws for the Obstacle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;So, &lt;em&gt;Too many secrets&lt;/em&gt; – in the area where the conflict has moved, there are lots
of small alleys, little houses, people living in basements due to high rent. Sounds like
Infantry will have difficulties reaching everyone in time. In some places, it looks even
like a small hanging city, with planks and scaffolding used to access some of the houses
(&lt;em&gt;Show of Skills&lt;/em&gt;). The maps for the area are clearly not very good (&lt;em&gt;Lack of Precision&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry draws:&lt;/p&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Well, my officers are pretty good, thank you very much. They didn&amp;rsquo;t reach their
rank (&lt;em&gt;Rising to Power&lt;/em&gt;) out of supidity, but thanks to their ability to organize their
soldiers even in high-pressure, low-information situations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry draws:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that this area is full of drug dens and low-grade brothels,
but my men are doing their work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Forth reversed card, first reports of losses. Vehicles were destroyed under the
feet of the beast. But we soldier on!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Communications are more complicated. The battlefield has reached us, isolating units
from their officers and from each other, but we will soldier on!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;But I have &lt;em&gt;Absolute Trust&lt;/em&gt; in my officers and soldiers, and they prove that they
deserve this trust, by saving a considerable number of civilians. Go ahead, Tokyo Mechanized
Defense Force, beat the monster!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;So, it looks like have taken some losses of both material and men in this labyrinth,
Good soldiers who could not get away in time after having saved the lives of so many civilians.
You will be remembered!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry writes down &lt;strong&gt;The battlefield has been evacuated&lt;/strong&gt; and adds the pair on the index card:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure
    class=&#34;yoric-hand &#34;&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 68&#34;
        /&gt;

            alt=&#34;Card number 65&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infantry may now give one or both of these cards to any character, as long as it makes sense that
the character is supported by the Aspect. The idea is to hand these cards to the Tokyo Mechanized
Defense Force, but the Air Force could be interested, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infantry adds &lt;strong&gt;The Infantry suffered losses&lt;/strong&gt;, on which the GM may now add two cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Since &lt;strong&gt;The battlefield has been evacuated&lt;/strong&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide air support, bombing
Levinulon as often as possible without hurting the Infantry or the Tokyo Mechanized Defense
Force.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, you have serious firepower at hand, so you could possibly hurt Levinulon severely.
On the other hand, you risk accidentally bombing either the Infantry or the Tokyo Mechanized
Defense Force, resulting in serious losses. Or maybe you wish to reduce your Risk and Reach?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Nah, let&amp;rsquo;s take chances.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Ok, so, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be Fairly (2) easy, with all your high-tech equipment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Cool. Should I use my Fair (2) Paper for intelligent strikes or my Superb (5) Serpent
for dogfighting and speed?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Depends on your style. If you&amp;rsquo;re playing it fast and furious, you could youse the Serpent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Serpent it is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM Draws&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Ok, I&amp;rsquo;ll draw.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Actually, wait a second. I&amp;rsquo;ll use one of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; Sleeve Cards against you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM takes one of the cards from &lt;strong&gt;The Infantry suffered losses&lt;/strong&gt;, covering one of his cards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;Since the &lt;strong&gt;Infantry has suffered losses&lt;/strong&gt; of vehicles and equipment, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Madness&lt;/em&gt; down there.
You&amp;rsquo;re going to receive contradictory reports from the battlefield, which don&amp;rsquo;t let you aim as well
as you want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t think so! I can use my cards to support the Air Force instead of you,
right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;As long as it makes sense in-story, yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;In this case, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; your cards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infantry: &amp;ldquo;Thanks to the great job done by the infantry, however, you&amp;rsquo;ll quickly receive precise
dispatches that will make your life easier.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Force Draws:&lt;/p&gt;

    /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is already a Success with an Effect of 2 and a Cost of 0. Pretty good for a single card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;My ace pilots are turning Levinulon&amp;rsquo;s huge size into a handicap, as it cannot turn
quickly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Air Force: &amp;ldquo;Mmmh&amp;hellip; Apparently, some of the ordnance we were loaded with is more dangerous to us than to
it. I&amp;rsquo;ll stop here, before I hit my colleagues by accident.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Force writes down &lt;strong&gt;Death from the skies&lt;/strong&gt; and adds three cards:&lt;/p&gt;

                    alt=&#34;Card number 76, horizontal&#34;
                
            
            alt=&#34;Card number 76&#34;
        /&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No Cost!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Tokyo Mechanized Defense Force plays again, they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use these three cards, which will
undoubtedly considerably tilt the balance!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Aspects and your Sleeve</title>

&lt;p&gt;While we have met Aspects a few times in this manual, so far,
we have mostly contented ourselves with writing them down.
Some are on your character sheet, some have been used to describe
NPCs, or consequences of actions. In this chapter, we will
discuss further what Aspects &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how they maybe used&lt;/em&gt;,
both for the benefit of your character and against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;aspects-in-narration&#34;&gt;Aspects in Narration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-the-sleeve/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights17.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sani ol-Molk – Sheherazade and the Sultan (from the One Thousand and One Nights) – Public Domain – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspect-are-facts&#34;&gt;Aspect are Facts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, Aspects are Facts. Anything that is written down
as an Aspect is true and undeniable. Aspects are one of the few strict
rules in this game that deal with what may or what may not be narrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a scene has Aspect
&lt;strong&gt;Dark and rainy outside&lt;/strong&gt;, then it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dark and rainy outside,
until there is a good in-story reason for this Aspect to become
irrelevant. At some point it, it is likely that the storm will pass
and the sun will rise. Unless your characters are some kind of weather
control mutants or omnipotent deities – and we&amp;rsquo;re going to assume that
they aren&amp;rsquo;t – this Aspect will stick to the
scene, and any event that takes place during that scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, whatever may happen &lt;em&gt;in a different scene&lt;/em&gt;, for the moment,
it is dark and rainy outside. One of the consequences of this is
that the Players and the GM alike are &lt;em&gt;forbidden&lt;/em&gt; from narrating
anything that contradicts this Fact. If you recall, a Challenge
is a single scene. Consequently, if the current scene has heroes
fighting vampires, and if they need a ray of sun to get rid of
these pesky light-allergic creatures, that is too bad for them,
because this cannot happen for the moment. The vampires might
suffer negative Effects from the Challenge, but the Reach of
the heroes will not, in any manner, offer the ability of exposing
vampires to the sun. Perhaps, after this Challenge, the scene
may be changed and altered, the clouds will split, dawn will
rise and the vampires will suffer from it. But not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this works both ways: if the heroes are the vampires,
fighting petty vampire hunters, regardless of the Cost of the
Challenge, the GM is forbidden from having the sun rise on
the now heroic bloodsuckers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspects-are-permissions&#34;&gt;Aspects are Permissions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as an Aspect closes some narrative avenues, an Aspect opens
others. Whether PC or NPC, a &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt; will, by
definition, know everything there is to know about being an
assassin and have access to all the equipment, money and contacts
that a professional assassin should have. Whenever the character
is involved in a Challenge, this Aspect will let the Player or GM
narrate both successes and failures as those of a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is true for a &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt; is, of course, even
more true whenever superpowers are involved, whether the character
is the &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Seas&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;World-class telekinetic&lt;/strong&gt;, the
&lt;strong&gt;Youngest Witchmistress of her Generation&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;Bumbling
Time Traveler&lt;/strong&gt;. These Aspects authorize you to narrate actions
that most characters in the setting wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, in any Challenge, Aspects have considerable impact
on Reach and Risk. As a &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt;, you may be able to
snipe the &lt;strong&gt;Modern Necromancer&lt;/strong&gt; before he raises an army of the
dead (Reach), but this Aspect won&amp;rsquo;t help you cast a counter-spell
(also Reach). As a &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Seas&lt;/strong&gt;, you may be able to shrug
anything that the whale hunters throw at you (Cost), but you may
suffer considerably if you can&amp;rsquo;t save the oiler ship (also Cost).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspects-and-balance&#34;&gt;Aspects and Balance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be tempting to assume that Aspects should make draws
easier, but they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t – simply to maintain the game somewhat
balanced and playable despite differences of power scale
between characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, for instance, a super-hero team with a &lt;strong&gt;Indestructible
Super-strong Flying Warrior Demi-goddess&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;Skilled archer
with trick arrows&lt;/strong&gt;, both of them PCs. Imagine them fighting
side-by-side against an &lt;strong&gt;Alien, Multi-bodied, Civilization-destroying Robot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of relative power, yes, the Demi-goddess is impossibly
stronger, and faster, than the Archer. In terms of game, though,
how fun would it for the players if only one could succeed their draws,
simply because of different Aspects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason for which, in movies and comics and novels and
stories of all kind that feature characters of different power levels,
each major character has the opportunity to affect the outcome of
a conflict. This is the reason for which, in N-Dimensional Tourists,
the Aspects of the characters do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; influence the Rank of Challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, consider the Challenge of attacking the Robot&amp;rsquo;s near-indestructible
Unobtainium body. The Robot is pretty slow and attacking it is not very
hard – in fact, the Rank of that Challenge is probably only Good (3). The
difficulty, in this case, is not in the attack, but in doing something
meaningful with it. As we have seen above, Aspects may very well influence
the Reach and Cost of a Challenge. So, while the Demi-goddess&amp;rsquo;s Reach allows
her to reasonably &lt;em&gt;Reduce the mobility of the Unobtainium Body even further
by damaging its limbs&lt;/em&gt;, the Archer&amp;rsquo;s trick explosive arrows
allow him to reasonably &lt;em&gt;Weaken the ground around the Robot, making it
fall into the sewers, where its mobility will be greatly reduced.&lt;/em&gt; If
the Demi-goddess attacks with unarmed combat, she may Risk &lt;em&gt;Being grappled
and immobilized by the Unobtainium Body&lt;/em&gt;. The Archer remains afar, so risks
very little for himself, but his strategy could prove &lt;em&gt;Dangerous for the
civilians still in the area&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus is Balance narratively maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-sleeve-economy&#34;&gt;The Sleeve Economy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/posts/tourists-the-sleeve/639px-Poker_cheating_20170611.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Santeri Viinamäki – A poker card in your Sleeve – Licensed under  Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International – Source: Wikimedia Commons&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen that each player starts a session by drawing three Sleeve Cards.
We have also seen that player can receive Sleeve Cards by conceding Challenges.
What we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen yet is how these Sleeve Cards are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;compelling-aspects&#34;&gt;Compelling Aspects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider our &lt;strong&gt;Cold-blooded Hitwoman&lt;/strong&gt;. What are the chances that there&amp;rsquo;s
an Interpol Taskforce after her? What are the chances that she already
knows the Di Carpa family, having already executed a contract for them?
Consider our &lt;strong&gt;Dark and rainy outside&lt;/strong&gt;
scene. What is the chance that this will lead to a blizzard? Consider
a character suffering from unhealed &lt;strong&gt;Leg Trauma&lt;/strong&gt;. What are the chances
that he&amp;rsquo;ll have to stop the chase due to terrible pain? Consider a
doorway, covered with bloody glyphs, through which a &lt;strong&gt;Hypnotic song&lt;/strong&gt;
may be heard. What are the chances that one of the heroes will listen
to the song of the siren and cross the threshold? Consider a setting
in which, because of Paradoxes, &lt;strong&gt;Killing Time-Travelers is More Trouble than it is Worth&lt;/strong&gt;.
What are the chances that the Robotic Overlords will capture and interrogate
the outmatched heroes, rather than executing them outright?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as Aspects enable and forbid stories from taking place, they can be
used to make something happen – or have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick the Aspect you wish to Compel. It can be any Aspect, belonging to
the scene, a PC, a NPC, an object&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick one of your Sleeve Cards. If you are the GM, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck, you
have an unlimited number of Sleeve Cards in the Space·Time Deck in
front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narrate &amp;ldquo;Since [the Aspect is true], chances are that [something else,
based on both this Aspect and the card you picked, is also true].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This mechanism is called a &lt;strong&gt;Compel&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are Compelling yourself,
a NPC, an object, a scene, or if you
are Compelling a PC to make their life easier&amp;hellip; the Sleeve Card goes
into the Space·Time Deck. If you are Compelling a PC to make their
life harder, the Sleeve Card is for that PC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the Compel is on a PC, that player may reject the Compel, in which
case you get to keep your Sleeve Card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compels require no Challenge. Once a Compel has been accepted, it becomes
automatically true, generally a new Aspect if that&amp;rsquo;s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For players, Compels typically serve to alter the story and make their
life easier. This is, often, how a character happens to already know a
place or a story or a NPC. This is also, sometimes, how a group of adventurers
hired to enter a dungeon and look for an artifact, happens to have already
acquired the map of the dungeon – or possibly already beaten it – on their
spare time, hence requiring the GM to adapt and improvise a new objective
for the plot. Or maybe, for a Demi-goddess, this is how you just decide
that a minor supervillain is no match for you, by simply Compelling your
victory in hand-to-hand combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the GM, Compels serve several objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are a good way to introduce NPCs, factions, objects and tie
them to the background of a PC;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are a good way to introduce new complications in the life of
the heroes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are a good way to make a PC do something that the player knows
is stupide, but that makes entire sense in-story (recall that the
player may refuse);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when the heroes are running low on Sleeve Cards, it is a good mechanism
to reload them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note for GMs: as a general guideline, if a player answers your narration
by &amp;ldquo;Oh, no!&amp;rdquo; and then eagerly takes the Sleeve Card offered, your Compel
was probably spot on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aspects-may-be-tricked&#34;&gt;Aspects may be Tricked&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way, there is another way to use Sleeve Cards and Aspects,
it&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;strong&gt;Tricking&lt;/strong&gt;, and it helps you during Challenges, by
letting you cover a card that you have just drawn or that your
opponent has just drawn, with one of the cards up your Sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick the Aspect you wish to &lt;strong&gt;Trick&lt;/strong&gt;. It could be one of your
Aspects, or it could belong to your opponent, to the scene, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick one of your Sleeve Cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpret the card you&amp;rsquo;re covering and narrate it as what you
    have just escaped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpret the card you&amp;rsquo;re using and narrate it as what ended
    up happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Narrate how the Aspect saved you, or helped save you from the
    one to the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the Challenge draws all cards at once. You may cover any
(or all) of the cards after they have all been drawn. You can only
use each Aspect once per Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule works both for the Players and the GM. However, for this
use, the GM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an unlimited Sleeve. The size of the Sleeve
depends on the importance of the Challenge. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss this in the
chapter dedicated to setting up advanced Challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role-Playing Game Pitch: Kingdom Came</title>
      <link>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/an-idea-kingdom-came/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2018 11:56:38 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/an-idea-kingdom-came/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rejoice, for the Kingdom of Death is no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was first reported Last Thursday, at 0421 GMT and it happened all over the globe: the dead have returned to walk among the living. They are disoriented, surely, and returned from Heaven or Hell or other places, but they are peaceful, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What most of them are no more is &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;. For &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the dead have returned, all since the first step of our kind, or possibly before, and few of them have a body to return to. The fresh ones, the ones who had died just a few moments after the event, those woke up without a pulse and continued their day without realizing that something was amiss. The decayed ones, the ones who had been in the ground or under the water for weeks or years or centuries, those woke up as creatures of their own nightmares, without context or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the rest? Those who had been cremated or destroyed by time or beasts or accident? Well, those had to find something to inhabit, didn&amp;rsquo;t they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, 0421 GMT is now known as the Kingdom Came event. And since Kingdom Came, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; can host a returned human being. It could be your toaster or a book in your library. It could be your favorite earring or your camera. It could be Google or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejoice, for the Kingdom of Death is no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejoice, for the Dead have returned, from Heaven or Hell or other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how will society cope?&lt;/p&gt;
