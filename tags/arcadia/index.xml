      <description>Expectations There is no Ultimate Truth to In Arcadia Ego. No well-structured cosmology, no detailed rules to determine what Arcadians can or cannot do, how to hurt them, trap them or heal them, or how magic interacts with technology. There is no canonical list of factions, artifacts, heroes and villains.
All these will need to emerge progressively from two things:
 the answers given by the players to the Player Document; whatever the characters do during the game.</description>

      <description>In Arcadia Ego was designed and tested with the following rulesets:
 Fate Accelerated (which you may download for free here); N-Dimensional Tourists (which you may download for free here).  Both rulesets are members of the family of Fate.
While you are encouraged to use whichever ruleset you prefer – whether Fate or anything else – you will need to understand and possibly adapt the notion of Aspects, which is used throughout the game.</description>

      <description>Welcome to In Arcadia Ego!
In Arcadia Ego is a narrative tabletop role-playing game for experienced GMs/Narrators. Each player takes the role of a regular person who, for some reason, has recently become Something Else – something we like to call an Arcadian. What is an Arcadian? Well, in fact, pretty much anything they can imagine, from a Bram Stoker-style Vampire to a creature of pure Mathematics made flesh, an Ancient God reborn or a fictional character become real.</description>
