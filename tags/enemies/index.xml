      <description>The Most Benevolent Administrators are believed to be leftovers of a dead branch of the Time Bureaucracy. They may be found scattered around time and space. While they look quite harmless – who would fear something that appears essentially to be photocopier on wheel tracks – the sheets of paper that they print sometimes make them very dangerous.
Most Benevolent Administrators are generally Poets and Philosophers, able of deep reflections on the nature of the human psyche, among others.</description>
