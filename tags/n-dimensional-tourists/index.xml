      <title>The Space Time Deck</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is a deck of 67 cards and a few blanks, loosely inspired
from Tarot decks, and designed to aid with story improv, including
Role-Playing Games and other forms of Storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the cards is designed to be interpreted on its own, and to be used
as part of a narrative role-playing ruleset. For both reasons, cards
have both illustrations and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is used throughout &lt;a href=&#34;http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/plotonomicon&#34;&gt;the Plotonomicon&lt;/a&gt;
for building plots, characters, places, factions, twists, etc. and
throughout &lt;a href=&#34;http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;the N-Dimensional Tourists&lt;/a&gt;
as a base for resolving obstacles, conflicts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Conflict Resolution</title>

      <description>These rules are part of the N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset.
Specifically, this entry describes a mechanism to resolve Conflicts between two parties or more during a role-playing game. It is designed to be generic enough to cover pretty much any kind of Conflict with the same mechanism, while remaining narrative.
As you&amp;rsquo;ll see in this chapter, this mechanism is freely inspired from both Tarot and Blackjack – and it uses the Space·Time Deck.</description>

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: On your Character Sheet</title>
      <link>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-attributes/</link>

      <description>In N-Dimensional Tourists, each major character is defined by:
 A Figure, which is used during improv. Any number of Aspects, which determine what the character can do; 5 Attributes, which determine how good a character is at their tasks; Any number of Specialties, which let them use Attributes in unusual manners; At least one Weakness, which makes their life more complicated.  Minor non-player characters are typically described in even broader strokes, at least until the story calls upon them to be defined in more details.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists is a lightweight, generic ruleset for fiction-first, narrative roleplaying.
Instead of dice, it uses the Space·Time Deck.&lt;/p&gt;
