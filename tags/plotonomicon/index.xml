      <description>Most Role-Playing Games resolve conflicts with dice. But since we have a Space·Time Deck at hand (or any other kind of Tarot-like Deck), let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can use it to bring about a different manner of resolving conflicts.
The following is an extract from the Work-in-Progress Plotonomicon.
What is a conflict? A conflict is a scene in which two parties or more have agendas which cannot be fulfilled simultaneously.</description>

      <description>After the Suit of Paper and the Suit of Rock, here comes the Suit of Scissor (or perhaps Blades – name to be finalized).
Warning Museum-level nudity.
Scissors/blade traditionally symbolize:
 change; violence; unavoidability.  The cards:
 Ruler  Dragon  Treasure  Soldier  Builder  Seeker  Lover  Servant  Home  Foot (blank, customizable)  Teddy bear (blank, customizable)   Note that the blue borders are not part of the cards.</description>

      <title>Improvising with the Space·Time Deck: V. Hello, you gorgeous!</title>

      <description>This is an extract from the Plotonomicon.
Note that we have just changed the picture from
The old picture (The Slaughter of the Innocents) one was considered too violent – while both are museum pieces, the first one depicts mass murder of children, and was thus discarded as not-safe-for-children&amp;rsquo;s-hands.
This new version gets rid of almost all violence, and offers much more symbolism, hence much more freedom of improv.</description>

      <description>Oops, the heroes have ruined the story, again. They managed to get Camelot invaded by the peaceful Seelie while King Arthur was at war, to kill teenage Karl Marx while vacationing in Space·Time or to blow up the Magical University where the entire campaign was meant to take place. Also, they have just entered the Unknowable Dungeon of Unspeakable Death, for which you have no maps, or they are due to meet the Ambassador of the Qfew&amp;rsquo;dhi Confederation, the one you just invented by pushing random keys on your keyboard.</description>
