      <title>The Space Time Deck</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is a deck of 67 cards and a few blanks, loosely inspired
from Tarot decks, and designed to aid with story improv, including
Role-Playing Games and other forms of Storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the cards is designed to be interpreted on its own, and to be used
as part of a narrative role-playing ruleset. For both reasons, cards
have both illustrations and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is used throughout &lt;a href=&#34;http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/plotonomicon&#34;&gt;the Plotonomicon&lt;/a&gt;
for building plots, characters, places, factions, twists, etc. and
throughout &lt;a href=&#34;http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;the N-Dimensional Tourists&lt;/a&gt;
as a base for resolving obstacles, conflicts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Plotonomicon: About This Book</title>
      <link>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/plotonomicon-about/</link>

      <guid>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/plotonomicon-about/</guid>
      <description>As all good things do, this book starts with a story.
It&amp;rsquo;s the story of a Game Master (let&amp;rsquo;s call her Alice), who spent weeks preparing a campaign for her players. Maybe the Players&amp;rsquo;s Characters were to be a company of heroes, who would save the land from a dragon. Or maybe they were students in magics, who were expected to find the sinister secrets of the Sorcerous Highschool. Or maybe they were survivors of a zombie apocalypse, who were to spend each of their days hiding from hordes of shambling undead.</description>

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Conflict Resolution</title>
      <link>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-conflict-resolution/</link>

      <guid>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-conflict-resolution/</guid>
      <description>These rules are part of the N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset.
Specifically, this entry describes a mechanism to resolve Conflicts between two parties or more during a role-playing game. It is designed to be generic enough to cover pretty much any kind of Conflict with the same mechanism, while remaining narrative.
As you&amp;rsquo;ll see in this chapter, this mechanism is freely inspired from both Tarot and Blackjack – and it uses the Space·Time Deck.</description>

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: On your Character Sheet</title>
      <link>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-attributes/</link>

      <guid>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-attributes/</guid>
      <description>In N-Dimensional Tourists, each major character is defined by:
 A Figure, which is used during improv. Any number of Aspects, which determine what the character can do; 5 Attributes, which determine how good a character is at their tasks; Any number of Specialties, which let them use Attributes in unusual manners; At least one Weakness, which makes their life more complicated.  Minor non-player characters are typically described in even broader strokes, at least until the story calls upon them to be defined in more details.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists is a lightweight, generic ruleset for fiction-first, narrative roleplaying.
Instead of dice, it uses the Space·Time Deck.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Well, after the Triumphs and four suits (Paper, Rock, Blade, Serpent), it is time to conclude the Space·Time Deck with its last suit: the Suit of Unknown (you are free to call it the Suit of Spock)!
Unknown symbolizes:
 imagination; intuition; perception; illusions; dreams.  Whenever you draw a card of this suit, you are encouraged to integrate any of these concepts to your interpretation.
The cards:
 Ruler  Dragon  Treasure  Soldier  Builder  Seeker  Lover  Servant  Home  Foot (blank, customizable)  Teddy bear (blank, customizable)   Credits  Cards David Teller.</description>

      <description>Did you think the Space·Time Deck was done after
 the Triumphs; the Suit of Paper; the Suit of Rock; the Suit of Blade?  Were it only that it were so simple!
Here&amp;rsquo;s the fourth suit: the Suit of Serpents.
Serpents traditionally symbolize:
 speed; stealth; adaptation; survival; lies; forbidden knowledge; forbidden power; temptation.  The cards:

      <title>Conflict Resolution With the Space·Time Deck</title>
      <link>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/conflict-resolution-with-the-space-time-deck/</link>

      <guid>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/conflict-resolution-with-the-space-time-deck/</guid>
      <description>Most Role-Playing Games resolve conflicts with dice. But since we have a Space·Time Deck at hand (or any other kind of Tarot-like Deck), let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can use it to bring about a different manner of resolving conflicts.
About Conflicts A Conflict is a scene in which two parties or more have agendas, which cannot be fulfilled simultaneously. In most role-playing games, the most common form of conflict is the combat, but that is by no mean the only form possible: conflict could be car races, social wit, political campaigns, chess, battlefield strategy, attempting to ruin your opponent&amp;rsquo;s reputation or fortune, popularity contests, football matches, etc.</description>

      <description>After the Suit of Paper and the Suit of Rock, here comes the Suit of Scissor (or perhaps Blades – name to be finalized).

Scissors/blade traditionally symbolize:
 forced change; violence; destiny; death.  The cards:

      <description>This is an extract from the Plotonomicon.
Note that we have just changed the picture from
The old picture (The Slaughter of the Innocents) one was considered too violent – while both are museum pieces, the first one depicts mass murder of children, and was thus discarded as not-safe-for-children&amp;rsquo;s-hands.
This new version gets rid of almost all violence, and offers much more symbolism, hence much more freedom of improv.</description>

      <description>Oops, the heroes have ruined the story, again. They managed to get Camelot invaded by the peaceful Seelie while King Arthur was at war, to kill teenage Karl Marx while vacationing in Space·Time or to blow up the Magical University where the entire campaign was meant to take place. Also, they have just entered the Unknowable Dungeon of Unspeakable Death, for which you have no maps, or they are due to meet the Ambassador of the Qfew&amp;rsquo;dhi Confederation, the one you just invented by pushing random keys on your keyboard.</description>
