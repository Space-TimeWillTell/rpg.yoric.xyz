      <description>Together, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-prepared, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed, well-trained, that&amp;rsquo;s even better. Well, whenever you group be together, or ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re well-prepared, well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed, well-trained or pretty much anything else, you are Creating an Advantage.
As most things in N-Dimensional Tourists, Advantages are basically Aspects and may represent just about anything that makes sense in-story. It could be a strong character providing the team with Muscle during a streetfight, or a Hand-up for climbing.</description>

      <title>Plotonomicon: Let&#39;s not prepare anything</title>

      <description>All good things start with stories. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a buzzphrase, by the way. If you are building a story, whether you are role-playing, storytelling for an audience or writing a book, the story comes first and everything else tends to follow naturally.
So let us start with, once again, a story.
Hope renewed Our story is set in a fantasy archipelago inhabited by dozens of sentient species, and loosely inspired from Ancient Greece, with larger ships.</description>

      <description>You know what? Let&amp;rsquo;s keep explanations for later. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with some action!
Imagine cars racing in the streets of Rio de Janeiro. It&amp;rsquo;s the present. Two of the heroes (let&amp;rsquo;s call them Desmond and Erika) share a sportscar, driving as fast as they can away from the HQ of Evil Corporation, where they just stole a USB stick. Our third hero (Frank) is in the gadget van, driving more slowly while keeping an eye on a map of traffic lights.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is a deck of 67 cards and a few blanks, loosely inspired
from Tarot decks, and designed to aid with story improv, including
Role-Playing Games and other forms of Storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the cards is designed to be interpreted on its own, and to be used
as part of a narrative role-playing ruleset. For both reasons, cards
have both illustrations and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is used throughout &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/plotonomicon&#34;&gt;the Plotonomicon&lt;/a&gt;
for building plots, characters, places, factions, twists, etc. and
throughout &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;the N-Dimensional Tourists&lt;/a&gt;
as a base for resolving obstacles, conflicts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>As all good things do, this book starts with a story.
It&amp;rsquo;s the story of a Game Master (let&amp;rsquo;s call her Alice), who spent weeks preparing a campaign for her players. Maybe the Players&amp;rsquo;s Characters were to be a company of heroes, who would save the land from a dragon. Or maybe they were students in magics, who were expected to find the sinister secrets of the Sorcerous Highschool. Or maybe they were survivors of a zombie apocalypse, who were to spend each of their days hiding from hordes of shambling undead.</description>

      <description>THIS CONTENT IS DEPRECATED Playtesting has indicated that these rules don&amp;rsquo;t work as well as hoped.
We&amp;rsquo;ll leave them here for historical reasons, but newer versions of N-Dimensional Tourists do not use these rules.
 These rules describes how to resolve Conflicts between two parties or more during a role-playing game using the N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset. This mechanism is designed to be generic enough to handle pretty much any kind, while remaining mostly narrative.</description>

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: On your Character Sheet</title>

      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-attributes/</guid>
      <description>In N-Dimensional Tourists, each major character is defined by:
 A Card, which is used during improv. Any number of Aspects, which determine what the character can do; 5 Attributes, which determine how good a character is at their tasks; Any number of Specialties, which let them use Attributes in unusual manners; At least one Weakness, which makes their life more complicated.  Minor non-player characters are typically described in even broader strokes, at least until the story calls upon them to be defined in more details.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists is a lightweight, generic ruleset for fiction-first, narrative roleplaying.
Instead of dice, it uses the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/space-time-deck&#34;&gt;Space·Time Deck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Well, after the Triumphs and four suits (Paper, Rock, Blade, Serpent), it is time to conclude the Space·Time Deck with its last suit: the Suit of Unknown (you are free to call it the Suit of Spock)!

 imagination; intuition; perception; illusions; dreams.  Whenever you draw a card of this suit, you are encouraged to integrate any of these concepts to your interpretation.
The cards:

      <description>Most Role-Playing Games resolve conflicts with dice. But since we have a Space·Time Deck at hand (or any other kind of Tarot-like Deck), let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can use it to bring about a different manner of resolving conflicts.
About Conflicts A Conflict is a scene in which two parties or more have agendas, which cannot be fulfilled simultaneously. In most role-playing games, the most common form of conflict is the combat, but that is by no mean the only form possible: conflict could be car races, social wit, political campaigns, chess, battlefield strategy, attempting to ruin your opponent&amp;rsquo;s reputation or fortune, popularity contests, football matches, etc.</description>

      <description>After the Suit of Paper and the Suit of Rock, here comes the Suit of Scissor (or perhaps Blades – name to be finalized).

 forced change; violence; destiny; death.  The cards:

      <description>This is an extract from the Plotonomicon.
Note that we have just changed the picture from
The old picture (The Slaughter of the Innocents) one was considered too violent – while both are museum pieces, the first one depicts mass murder of children, and was thus discarded as not-safe-for-children&amp;rsquo;s-hands.
This new version gets rid of almost all violence, and offers much more symbolism, hence much more freedom of improv.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oops, the heroes have ruined the story, again. They managed to get Camelot invaded by the peaceful Seelie while King Arthur was at war, to kill teenage Karl Marx while vacationing in Space·Time or to blow up the Magical University where the entire campaign was meant to take place. Also, they have just entered the Unknowable Dungeon of Unspeakable Death, for which you have no maps, or they are due to meet the Ambassador of the Qfew&amp;rsquo;dhi Confederation, the one you just invented by pushing random keys on your keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess it&amp;rsquo;s time to switch to improv mode!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will King Arthur Pendragon react to news of the invasion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will history readjust itself without Karl Marx?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will the Unseen Council protect the Mundane Sphere without the Sevenfold Anchor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What evil lurks in the Unknowable Dungeon of Unspeakable Death?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does a Qfew&amp;rsquo;dhi even look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog knows! The Space·Time Deck knows!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(well, or at least, they can help you improvise an answer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/images/plotonomicon/cover.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a Game Master, a Player, a Writer, or any kind of Storyteller, this book and its companion Space·Time Deck
are designed for you. Because you may need to improvise characters on the fly, to explore dungeons without maps,
to spice up fights and altercations and pursuits and confrontations of all sorts, to come up with exotic planets,
unheard of magical creatures, threats past and future, not to mention stories, stories-within-stories and
ultimate plot twists, all of this without breaking pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, we are here for you. We bring you improv and storytelling tricks and techniques,
examples, and a tarot-like deck of cards designed to help you keep your stories varied,
interesting and fun!&lt;/p&gt;
