      <description>The Space·Time Deck is a card deck designed to be used as an improv tool, both for storytelling and role-playing games.
                         We will be posting more about this deck in future posts.
Note that the oddly large margins are there by design. We&amp;rsquo;ll try and offer this deck for on-demand printing, and such margins are required by printers.</description>

      <description>« Nobody remembers with certainty in which year the Great Snafu took place, but people generally agree that it was on a September, or perhaps on a Saturday afternoon, on some even-numbered millenium. Also, it involved blowing up the Universe, which made pretty much everybody unhappy, except for a few people who had been waiting for this opportunity to loudly exclaim &amp;ldquo;I told you so&amp;rdquo;, and even they were not happy for long.</description>
