      <title>The Plotonomicon: Creating Worlds</title>

      <description>In the Plotonomicon, creating a world is, much like creating a character, a series of Questions. Where creating a player&amp;rsquo;s character is generally a dialogue between the GM and that player, creating a world is one that involves everybody around the table.
Before starting, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to decide how much detail you want to put in your world – there&amp;rsquo;s no limit to how much time you can spend creating a world, if you enjoy doing so, but maybe you want to use that world immediately.</description>

      <title>N-Dimensional Tourists: Stronger Together</title>

      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/tourists-parties/</guid>
      <description>Together, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-prepared, we&amp;rsquo;re stronger. Well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed, well-trained, that&amp;rsquo;s even better. Well, whenever you group be together, or ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re well-prepared, well-fed, well-rested, well-equipped, well-informed, well-trained or pretty much anything else, you are Creating an Advantage.
As most things in N-Dimensional Tourists, Advantages are basically Aspects and may represent just about anything that makes sense in-story. It could be a strong character providing the team with Muscle during a streetfight, or a Hand-up for climbing.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is a deck of 67 cards and a few blanks, loosely inspired
from Tarot decks, and designed to aid with story improv, including
Role-Playing Games and other forms of Storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the cards is designed to be interpreted on its own, and to be used
as part of a narrative role-playing ruleset. For both reasons, cards
have both illustrations and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space·Time Deck is used throughout &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/plotonomicon&#34;&gt;the Plotonomicon&lt;/a&gt;
for building plots, characters, places, factions, twists, etc. and
throughout &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/n-dimensional-tourists&#34;&gt;the N-Dimensional Tourists&lt;/a&gt;
as a base for resolving obstacles, conflicts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>THIS CONTENT IS DEPRECATED Playtesting has indicated that these rules don&amp;rsquo;t work as well as hoped.
We&amp;rsquo;ll leave them here for historical reasons, but newer versions of N-Dimensional Tourists do not use these rules.
 These rules describes how to resolve Conflicts between two parties or more during a role-playing game using the N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset. This mechanism is designed to be generic enough to handle pretty much any kind, while remaining mostly narrative.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;N-Dimensional Tourists is a lightweight, generic ruleset for fiction-first, narrative roleplaying.
Instead of dice, it uses the &lt;a href=&#34;https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/space-time-deck&#34;&gt;Space·Time Deck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Well, after the Triumphs and four suits (Paper, Rock, Blade, Serpent), it is time to conclude the Space·Time Deck with its last suit: the Suit of Unknown (you are free to call it the Suit of Spock)!

      <title>Conflict Resolution With the Space·Time Deck</title>

      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/conflict-resolution-with-the-space-time-deck/</guid>
      <description>Most Role-Playing Games resolve conflicts with dice. But since we have a Space·Time Deck at hand (or any other kind of Tarot-like Deck), let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can use it to bring about a different manner of resolving conflicts.
About Conflicts A Conflict is a scene in which two parties or more have agendas, which cannot be fulfilled simultaneously. In most role-playing games, the most common form of conflict is the combat, but that is by no mean the only form possible: conflict could be car races, social wit, political campaigns, chess, battlefield strategy, attempting to ruin your opponent&amp;rsquo;s reputation or fortune, popularity contests, football matches, etc.</description>

      <guid>https://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/why-cards/</guid>
      <description>Earlier, we have posted the Space·Time Deck.
It&amp;rsquo;s a set of cards, designed to help with improv.
But why cards?
In theory, an improv Storyteller should be able to use anything as support for improvisation. That&amp;rsquo;s true whether they&amp;rsquo;re performing for an audience, or improvising a plot for an ongoing Role-Playing Game, or improvising their character as a RPG player, or writing a book.
Do you know the ideal improviser? His name is Keyser Söze.</description>
