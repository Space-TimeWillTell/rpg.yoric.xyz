      <description>About these rules These rules are part of the N-Dimensional Tourists ruleset.
Specifically, this entry describes a mechanism to resolve Conflicts between two parties or more during a role-playing game.
This mechanism is designed to be abstract and generic – it works just as well with a pirate crew boarding a merchan ship as with two Formula 1 pilots racing each other or three political parties attempting to win or steal the elections.</description>

      <title>Conflict Resolution With the Space·Time Deck</title>

      <description>Most Role-Playing Games resolve conflicts with dice. But since we have a Space·Time Deck at hand (or any other kind of Tarot-like Deck), let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can use it to bring about a different manner of resolving conflicts.
About Conflicts A Conflict is a scene in which two parties or more have agendas, which cannot be fulfilled simultaneously. In most role-playing games, the most common form of conflict is the combat, but that is by no mean the only form possible: conflict could be car races, social wit, political campaigns, chess, battlefield strategy, attempting to ruin your opponent&amp;rsquo;s reputation or fortune, popularity contests, football matches, etc.</description>

      <title>Improv(is)ing stories with cards</title>
      <link>http://space-timewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/why-cards/</link>

      <description>Earlier, we have posted the Space·Time Deck.
It&amp;rsquo;s a set of cards, designed to help with improv.
But why cards?
In theory, an improv Storyteller should be able to use anything as support for improvisation. That&amp;rsquo;s true whether they&amp;rsquo;re performing for an audience, or improvising a plot for an ongoing Role-Playing Game, or improvising their character as a RPG player, or writing a book.
Do you know the ideal improviser? His name is Keyser Söze.</description>
