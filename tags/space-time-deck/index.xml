      <description>Most Role-Playing Games resolve conflicts with dice. But since we have a Space·Time Deck at hand (or any other kind of Tarot-like Deck), let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can use it to bring about a different manner of resolving conflicts.
The following is an extract from the Work-in-Progress Plotonomicon.
What is a conflict? A conflict is a scene in which two parties or more have agendas which cannot be fulfilled simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Improv(is)ing stories with cards</title>
      <link>http://spacetimewilltell.yoric.xyz/post/why-cards/</link>

      <description>Earlier, we have posted the Space·Time Deck.
It&amp;rsquo;s a set of cards, designed to help with improv.
But why cards?
In theory, an improv Storyteller should be able to use anything as support for improvisation. That&amp;rsquo;s true whether they&amp;rsquo;re performing for an audience, or improvising a plot for an ongoing Role-Playing Game, or improvising their character as a RPG player, or writing a book.
Do you know the ideal improviser? His name is Keyser Söze.</description>
